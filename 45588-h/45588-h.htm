<div class='c000'><span class='larger'>Foreword</span></div>

<p class='c003'>This book is intended to encourage a friendly attitude
towards people of other lands. Fast steamers,
airplanes, and the radio have made the people of all
lands neighbors, and American boys and girls must
become better acquainted with their neighbors across
the seas if they are to understand and appreciate
them. Through material such as is given in <i>Near the
Top of the World</i>, children may come to know interesting
and likable people of another country, and to
regard them as people like themselves, not as queer
or amusing.</p>

<p class='c003'>The author traveled widely in Scandinavia for the
purpose of gathering material. She watched the people,
especially the children, at work and play. She
visited homes, schools, libraries, farms, saeters, Lapp
settlements. She talked with teachers, librarians, and
other citizens of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark,
and they assisted her generously in seeing and interpreting
life in their lands.</p>

<p class='c003'>The pictures which illustrate the stories are photographs,
some of them taken by the author. For other
pictures she is grateful to the American-Swedish
News Exchange, New York, the Norwegian Government
Railway, New York, and the Danish Government
Railway, New York.</p>

<p class='c003'>The vocabulary is simple and although the book
was written for no specific grade, the sentence structure
has been adapted to third grade reading. The
stories were tested in third grade classrooms and revised
to remove any difficulties that were encountered.
The vocabulary was checked with the Gates
Word List and the Thorndike Word List with the
following results: 74 per cent of the words in the
random sampling fall in the Gates 1500 list; 84 per
cent in Thorndike’s first 2000 list, 90 per cent in
Thorndike’s first 3000 list, and 94 per cent in Thorndike’s
first 5000 list. Very few unusual words have
been used.</p>

<p class='c003'>The material has numerous possibilities for classroom
use:</p>

<div class='c000'>(<i>a</i>) <i>As a Social Science Reader</i></div>

<p class='c003'>The book will be of special service to teachers seeking
material for units of study on other lands for
social science classes. Curriculum makers for elementary
schools have set up such units to break away
from the more formal units of geography and history,
but have found their attempts to be only partially
successful because of the dearth of suitable reading
material to put into the hands of the pupils.</p>

<div class='c000'>(<i>b</i>) <i>As Supplementary to Geography</i></div>

<p class='c003'>Schools having separate courses in geography will
find <i>Near the Top of the World</i> a valuable supplementary
reader. From the story Greeting a Strange
Sun to the story Planting of the Flag of Norway at
the Bottom of the Earth, there are experiences to
help children interpret how people make their ways
of living fit the land in which they live.</p>

<div class='c000'>(<i>c</i>) <i>As Supplementary to History</i></div>

<p class='c003'>In the folklore, the Viking tales, the descriptions
of castles and open-air museums, the readers of <i>Near
the Top of the World</i> see history as the background
for the present-day life of Norway, Sweden, and
Denmark.</p>

<div class='c000'>(<i>d</i>) <i>For Recreational Reading</i></div>

<p class='c003'>Boys and girls, always interested in children of
other lands, will find the book one to read just for
fun. It will be especially liked by the children in
America who are of Scandinavian origin or who have
relatives in the Scandinavian countries.</p>

<p class='c003'>In whatever way the book is used, the readers
cannot fail to make interesting discoveries about the
Scandinavian countries that have so generously contributed
to American citizenship.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Children of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark live
near the top of the world. Some of them dance round
the Yule tree on a day as dark as night and round
the Maypole on a night as light as day!</p>

<p class='c003'>On the map of the top of the world on the next
page you can find their lands.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>Kari and Lars live near the top of Norway. They
travel by boat. They see the fishing boats and the
birds that roost on the rocky walls near the sea.</p>

<p class='c003'>The little Lapp girl and her dog also live in that
land far to the north. But to them it is the land of the
reindeer. They wander from place to place. They
live in tents or rude huts wherever the reindeer find
food.</p>

<p class='c003'>Olaf of Norway and Gerda of Sweden live farther
to the south of those lands. To them in winter their
land is a land of skis. And to many girls and boys
Norway and Sweden in winter is a land of Christmas
trees.</p>

<p class='c003'>

Harold lives in America, but he knows the lands
near the top of the world. His grandmother lives in
Norway and his cousin lives in Sweden. To Harold
those lands make many a storybook tale come true.
When he visited them he saw the old Viking boats
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_3' id='Page_3'>3</a></span>
which were like the boat in which Leif Ericsson
sailed to America so long ago. He saw castles where
boys long ago were dubbed knights.</p>

Christian lives on the flat lands of Denmark. Denmark
was the home of the great story-teller, Hans
Christian Andersen.</p>

<p class='c003'>But now turn the pages of this book and let these
children, and many others too, tell you stories from
that land near the top of the world.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>5</a></span>
  <h2 id='story02' class='c008'><b>Greeting a Strange Sun</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>About noon, one day late in January, a group of
school children dressed in warm coats, caps, and mittens
stood in the snow eagerly waiting for something.
Suddenly one of the big boys pulled a rope that sent
the flag to the top of its pole. There it waved a
greeting as over the edge of the earth peeped the
sun!</p>

<p class='c003'>While the children watched, the rim of gold became
half a round ball. Then it began to drop and
in an hour no part of that ball could be seen in the
sky.</p>

<p class='c003'>Those children live in a town near the top of the
world. Weeks and weeks had passed since they had
seen the sun. About the time that American children
were having Thanksgiving the sun had dropped
from sight. There was no sunshine in that northern
town on Christmas day. The children went to school
through cold dark streets lighted by electricity. Then
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
came days when there was a pale light in the sky,
like the dawn that comes just before the sun rises.
At last came that day in January when the sun appeared.
No wonder the flag was raised to greet him!</p>

<p class='c003'>As those children greeted the big shining ball they
knew that now they would see the sun in the sky for
months. Each day it would stay a little longer.</p>

<p class='c003'>Time went on. One day about the middle of May
the children saw the sun in the east early in the
morning not to set again for weeks and weeks. Each
day it seemed to move around the sky in a big circle
near the ground. To girls and boys who live in the
far north of Norway and Sweden the sun seems to
go <em>around</em> their homes, not <em>over</em> them from east to
west as we see it. The picture of the midnight sun
shows just how the sun seems to move around low
in the sky. Of course, as you know, the earth is
really moving around the sun.</p>

<p class='c003'>For many weeks the children had sunshine while
they worked and while they played. No longer did
they have to work in their schoolrooms by electric
light. They ate their breakfasts, dinners, and suppers
while the sun shone. They even had sunshine
while they slept, sunshine all through the night. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
sun did not set again until late in July. And in July
the sun was gone from the sky only a few hours each
night.</p>

<div id='img03' class='figcenter'>

<p>THIS PICTURE SHOWS HOW THE SUN SEEMS TO MOVE AROUND THE HORIZON<br/>An exposure was made every 20 minutes without<br/>changing the position of the camera</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Day after day the sun was gone for a little longer
time until one day in November it set again not to
return until the next January.</p>

<p class='c003'>Hammerfest, the town in which those children
live, is in Norway. It is farther north than any other
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
town in the world. It is a small town with only about
six hundred homes.</p>

<p class='c003'>The homes in Hammerfest are built of wood.
Many of them are not painted and the wood has
turned dark brown from the weather. Other homes
are painted white, light green, pink, and blue.
These colored houses are pretty with their roofs of
red tile.</p>

<p class='c003'>The streets are narrow and look very bare without
trees, and few trees can grow in the cold of the far
north. Hammerfest has a park with a half-dozen or
more trees and just outside the town stands a lone
tree—the most northern tree in the world. The
school children are proud of those few trees even
though they are no larger than shrubs. They point
them out to the visitors who come to their town.</p>

<div id='img04' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic006'>
<a href='images/img04f.jpg'><img src='images/img04.jpg' alt='' class='ig006' /></a>
<p>THIS TREE IS FARTHER NORTH THAN ANY OTHER TREE IN THE WORLD</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Hammerfest faces the sea. The girls and boys of
Hammerfest hurry to meet the ships that stop on
their shores. They look to see what flag each ship
flies. When they see the flag of a ship they are sure
to know from what country it comes. They see ships
with Swedish flags, ships with Danish flags, ships
with Dutch flags, ships with English flags, ships with
American flags, and many other ships with other
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
flags. The boys like to watch ships unload coal, machinery,
grain, and foodstuffs; and to watch other
ships being loaded with fish, cod-liver oil, and hides.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
Both the boys and the girls like to go aboard the passenger
ships that visit their port. Sometimes they
try to talk to the passengers. They hear many
strange languages—English, Dutch, French, German,
and Italian. They see people from many different
countries—England, Scotland, America, Holland,
France, Germany, and Italy. People from almost
all over the world stop at Hammerfest on the
large steamers which carry them to the very top of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
Norway to a big rock that sticks out into the Arctic
Ocean. That rock called the North Cape is less than
one hundred miles from Hammerfest. Many, many
people visit the North Cape each summer at the time
when the sun shines there at midnight.</p>

<p class='c003'>During the summer the girls and boys play along
the shores of the Arctic Ocean. Often they find wood
that has been carried in by the waves. We call such
wood driftwood. When the cool evenings come driftwood
is fine for burning in open fireplaces. One day
some of the boys found pieces of strange wood and
bark. An old sailor told them that those pieces were
from the great palm trees which grow far to the
south where the sun shines all the year round. It
had been carried to them by the warm stream of
water which also keeps their shores from freezing
even in the cold winters.</p>

<p class='c003'>Visitors who walk along the streets of that town
far to the north get a strong smell of cod-liver oil.
Hammerfest has a big factory where men make cod-liver
oil. They take the livers from codfish and
press them to get the oil. Then they put the oil in
large barrels ready for ships to carry it away to other
parts of Norway and to countries far away. Many
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
girls and boys in America have tasted cod-liver oil
from Hammerfest, as much of it is sold in our country.</p>

<p class='c003'>Many of the children of Hammerfest have never
seen a street-car nor a train. But they have electric
lights in their homes and on their streets. Their
town is too small to need street-cars and, because of
the mountains and the great distances between the
towns, no railroads have been built in that land so
far north. But those children get their mail and
packages from boats. They travel by boats too.
Their boats come all the year round as regularly as
trains in towns on the railroads.</p>

<p class='c003'>Perhaps some children will think, “But surely
ships cannot visit those northern shores in the winter
when the sun is gone from the sky. The waters
must be frozen.” But they are wrong about the
northern lands near the sea. Ships come and go all
the year round. Those waters are never frozen.</p>

<p class='c003'>Those northern shores are warmed in a strange
way. South of the United States of America is a
body of water called the Gulf of Mexico. That body
of water lies at a place on the earth where it gets
warm sunshine all the year round. The water is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
always very warm. It is that warm water which keeps
the land near the top of the earth warm.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Gulf of Mexico seems to act in a way similar
to a tank in the basement of a large house which
sends water to heat the rooms far from the basement.
A stream of warm water from that warm gulf
is carried thousands of miles across the ocean to the
shores of this northland. This is called the Gulf
Stream. And the Gulf Stream keeps those shores
warm enough for people to live there comfortably
even during the months when no sun shines.</p>

<p class='c003'>Some people who have traveled in many parts of
the world have visited this town farther north than
any other town in the world. Some of them say,
“Hammerfest is not only the town which lies farthest
north; it is also unlike any other town in the
world.” And perhaps that is what the readers of this
book are thinking too.</p>

  <h2 id='story03' class='c008'><b>On the Seas of the Far North</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Clang! Clang! sounded the bell of the boat. Lars
and Kari hurriedly said good-bye to father and
mother and ran over the narrow plank to the boat.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lars and Kari live in Hammerfest. They were going
to visit their grandmother who lives about a two-days’
ride to the south of their home.</p>

<p class='c003'>Soon their bags were put into the cabins where
they would sleep that night and they were on the
deck waving their hands to their parents. Then in
big comfortable chairs, they sat on the deck. It was
August and the air was cool and pleasant.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lars liked best to watch the boatmen do their
work, but Kari wanted to see the land they passed.
You might think that Kari could see land only to the
left, for on the left is the coast of Norway, and surely
there is only water on the right toward the sea. But
much of the time Kari saw land on both sides. Sometimes,
though, the land on the right was only huge
rocks in the water, or small spots of land with water
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
all around them where only birds live. But part of
the way the pieces of land on the right were so
large that Kari could not see the ends of them.
They were only small islands with water all around
them too. Lars and Kari were going to an island.
Their grandmother lived in a town built on an island
off the coast of Norway.</p>

<div id='img06' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic008'>

<p>LARS AND KARI ON THE DECK OF THE SHIP</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>For a long time both Lars and Kari watched the
coast of Norway on their left. For miles and miles
they saw rolling banks of earth covered with shrubs
of birch not even as tall as the one-story houses
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
along the coast which were the homes of fishermen.</p>

<p class='c003'>Soon they heard the whistle of the boat. Lars said
that the whistle was blowing because they were coming
to a town. They ran to the other side of the boat.
By that time the boat was stopping, but it was still
out in the water some distance from the town. A
rowboat was coming from the town to meet the boat.
The rowboat was bringing mail and packages for the
large boat, and it would take back to shore the mail,
packages, and passengers.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lars and Kari had plenty of time to see the town.
It was a fishing town. Fish were hanging on lines all
along the bank, and more fish were stretched upon
the ground to dry in the sun. The captain told Lars
that the fish were herring. Perhaps some of the
boxes that were loaded on the boat were boxes of
herring which would be sent to America, for American
merchants buy a great deal of herring from
Norway.</p>

<p class='c003'>The boat had not gone far from the fishing town
when Lars saw a fishing boat. He called to Kari and
together they leaned over the rail of their boat to
watch the fishermen. They had never seen so many
fish before. But they were soon watching the large
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
gulls that flew along after the fishing boat. Some of
the birds left the fishing boat and followed their
boat. The gulls came so close that Kari almost
touched one as it floated along right over her head.</p>

<p class='c003'>Kari told the captain about the gulls that evening
when they were eating supper in the dining room
on the boat. The captain said, “During the night the
boat will pass a mountain where thousands and
thousands of birds roost on the rocks.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Can we see the birds from the boat?” asked
Lars.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You could see them,” replied the captain, “if you
were awake, but the boat will pass that rock at three
o’clock in the morning. You will be sound asleep.”</p>

<p class='c003'>But Lars and Kari begged so hard that the captain
promised to have them called when the boat was
near the bird roost.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lars and Kari didn’t want to go to bed that night.
They watched the sun on the mountain peaks of the
islands to their right and then back of them to the
north. At ten o’clock the sun was still sending a
glowing light over the water. The captain said that
it would shine until about eleven that night. But
Kari thought that they should go to bed at ten
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
o’clock so that they could get a good sleep before
three o’clock.</p>

<p class='c003'>At three o’clock the steward of the boat knocked
at the cabin door. Lars and Kari jumped up quickly.
Each one pulled on warm stockings and shoes and
coat and cap. They hurried to the deck. The sun
was shining brightly again; in fact it had risen two
hours earlier.</p>

<div id='img07' class='figcenter'>

<p>BIRDS FRIGHTENED BY THE BOAT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Suddenly the boat moved close to a rocky wall.
Such a screaming of bird cries! There on the rocks
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
were so many, many birds that they never could
have counted them. And many more, frightened by
the boat, were flying about in the air crying wildly.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lars and Kari were delighted to have seen the
thousands of birds at their resting place on the rocks,
but they were glad to go back to bed, even though
the sun was so high in the sky. And they slept until
eight o’clock too.</p>

<p class='c003'>Before noon they reached the island where their
grandmother lived. A boat came from the shore to
meet them. They said good-bye to the captain and
the other workers on the boat and went to the shore
where their grandmother was waiting for them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
  <h2 id='story04' class='c008'><b>Fishing Islands</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Lars stayed on the island with his grandmother
that winter. He went to a larger and better school
than the one in Hammerfest.</p>

<p class='c003'>At first Lars thought, “How lonely I shall be when
the days are short and the nights are long.” To his
surprise he found that the days with little sunshine
were the busiest days on the islands. Lars was on
one of the Lofoten islands where thousands of fishermen
catch fish during the time of the long nights.</p>

<p class='c003'>Late in January the fishing boats began to arrive.
Before many days thousands of boats had come. The
boats brought thousands and thousands of fishermen.
The huts along the coast were soon opened. The quiet
spots were now noisy with the chugging of boats and
the voices of busy people.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lars soon made friends with some fisher people.
One old fisherman told him many things that he
wanted to know about the cod, for that is the fish
those fishermen came to Lofoten to catch.</p>

<div id='img08' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic010'>
<a href='images/img08f.jpg'><img src='images/img08.jpg' alt='' class='ig010' /></a>
<p>FISH HUNG ON POLES TO DRY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
Why did the fishermen come at this time of the
year? Were there no cod in these waters in the
summer? Those were questions Lars asked the old
fisherman.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lars learned that the cod were great travelers.
They had come from the big Atlantic Ocean to reach
the Lofoten Islands. Great numbers of cod swim together.
They reach those waters of the Lofoten late
in January. By the time the water is dark with the
fish, the fishermen are ready to begin their fishing.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
But the waters in the Lofotens get many, many
more fish than those which come in from the Atlantic.
It is in the waters of these islands that the
cod mothers lay the eggs from which baby cod are
hatched. And millions and millions of baby cod are
hatched each year.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lars watched some fishermen fastening a fishing
line on the shore. The line was a strong and heavy
cord. Most of the lines used by the Lofoten fishermen
are five or six thousand feet long. The long
fishing line is held near the top of the water by corks
which will not sink. The long line is taken far out to
sea by the boats. The end of the long line has a
heavy weight fastened to it. That weight is dropped
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
into the water and it holds the fishing line in the
place that the fishermen want it. Short lines are fastened
to each long line. The short lines have hooks
upon them. More than a thousand hooks are
dropped into the water from each long fishing line.</p>

<div id='img09' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic011'>
<a href='images/img09f.jpg'><img src='images/img09.jpg' alt='' class='ig011' /></a>
<p>THIS FISHING BOAT HAD A GOOD CATCH</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Some of the fishermen use nets instead of lines.
They go out in boats to set their nets.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
Each morning the fishing boats with the fishermen
go out to take the fish off the hooks on the lines and
to put more bait on the hooks, or to empty the fish
from the nets. Lars wanted to go out in the boat
with his friend, but the old fisherman said that fishing
was too dangerous for a young boy like Lars.</p>

<p class='c003'>The fishing is so dangerous that the Government
of Norway sends officers to the islands every winter
to help protect the fishermen. No fishing boat is
allowed to leave the shore to go to the lines or nets
until the officer gives the signal that the waters are
safe. But in spite of the help of the officers many
lives are lost in those waters each year.</p>

<p class='c003'>One morning Lars saw the flag which was the signal
of the officer that the sea was safe for the fishing
boats. Then he saw the thousands of boats start out
to sea to look after the lines and nets. There were
rowboats, motor boats, steamboats, and sailboats.
He could see the boats far off the shores for hours as
the men worked to load the fish they had caught.</p>

<p class='c003'>Five hundred fish is a good catch for a boat, but
sometimes a boat brings in a thousand cod at one
haul. After a few days of fishing, fish are everywhere
on the islands. They hang on poles along the shore.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
They lie stretched on the rocks. And everywhere is
the smell of fish.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lars watched the fishermen taking the livers out
of the fish and boxing them. He knew that many of
the livers would be sent to Hammerfest where he
lived, and there they would be made into cod-liver
oil.</p>

  <h2 id='story05' class='c008'><b>The Giants of the North Lands</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Once upon a time very strong giants lived on the
high mountains of the North lands. So fairy tales of
the far north say. And according to those tales, the
giants pulled up great bits of earth leaving deep
hollow places between rocky walls. Water from the
sea filled those hollow places, so arms of the sea ran
far back into the land. And those giants also tore
great rocks out of the earth and tossed them at each
other in their battles. So even the tops of the mountains
are rough and uneven with the holes they tore
in the earth and huge rocks lie on the ground where
they tossed them.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
Visitors to that part of Norway called Jotunheim,
which means the “Home of the Giants,” might believe
that those fairy tales were true. For they see
the arms of the sea running between the mountain
walls and the rough land on top of the mountains.
Surely none but giants’ hands could have torn the
land into such shapes!</p>

<div id='img10' class='figcenter'>

<a href='images/img10f.jpg'><img src='images/img10.jpg' alt='' class='ig012' /></a>
<p>FREDRIK</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>But when they go to the tops of the mountains,
they see some <em>real giants</em> like those which, long, long
ago, did cut the land of Norway and Sweden and
Denmark into strange forms. Those giants are
sheets of ice. We call them glaciers. Before travelers
in the mountains get near the large ice-sheets, they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
see tongues of glaciers which look like rivers of ice
running down the side of the mountain.</p>

<p class='c003'>Fredrik is a Norwegian boy who helps many travelers
see a glacier. His father drives an automobile
for a large hotel in the mountains. He takes the guests
from the hotel to see the glacier. When Fredrik is
not in school, he goes with his father. Fredrik opens
the many gates. For the car must travel through
lands which belong to different farmers. The gates
must be kept shut so that the cattle will not stray
away from their own land.</p>

<p class='c003'>Fredrik often tells the visitors what caused those
rivers of ice. Snow and sleet fell on the mountains.
The cold on the high peaks kept the snow from melting
away, so year after year the snow gathered there.
The load of snow became heavier and heavier. The
snow melted a little, then froze again, until it formed
a great ice sheet which we call a glacier.</p>

<p class='c003'>Some of the ice moved slowly down the mountain
side. It formed the rivers of ice which the travelers
see on the mountain slopes. But as the rivers of ice
got lower down the mountain, the ice melted, but it
melted very, very slowly. Little by little, only a few
inches a year, the river of ice has moved back. As
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
the ice moved down the slopes it carried under it
big rocks and fine gravel. Great heaps of the rock
and gravel are left behind when the ice melts. From
those rocks men can tell just how far the ice moves
back each year.</p>

<div id='img11' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic013'>
<a href='images/img11f.jpg'><img src='images/img11.jpg' alt='' class='ig013' /></a>
<p>WALKING ON A GLACIER</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Sometimes the ice melts in such a way that a cave
is formed in the ice. As the sun shines on the thin
walls around the cave the colors on the ice are very
beautiful. The ice looks green, purple, and blue instead
of white like the rest of the glacier. Some bits
of the ice hang down, or stick up, like great icicles.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
The icicles too are bright colors in the sunshine.</p>

<p class='c003'>Sometimes visitors to the glacier go into the cave
or walk about on the ice. They do not stay long, for
the ice cracks and pops and makes a great deal of
noise. The visitors are always told that pieces of ice
often break off the glacier and come sliding down.</p>

<p class='c003'>Fredrik has been up to the top where the great
ice-sheet lies for miles, and miles, and miles. You
may be sure that Fredrik was not alone on the glacier.
He went with a guide who knew where all the
cracks in the ice are. Walking on a glacier is dangerous
for a person who does not know the ice. The ice
is most dangerous when soft snow covers the deep
cracks in the ice. Then a traveler may step on some
soft snow and drop several feet into the ice. But
travelers say that a walk on a glacier is great sport
for people who have learned how to walk there.
Many travelers from different parts of the world go
to Norway to climb glaciers.</p>

<p class='c003'>Freezing and thawing made the rocks on the
mountain crack and break. So after the glaciers
passed, the low places between the mountains were
cut deeper. Water from the sea came in to fill those
low places and make the fjords.</p>

<div id='img12' class='figcenter'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
So the great ice sheets were the <em>real</em> giants that
made the sharp peaks of the mountains, the waterways,
and the lakes of the north land.</p>

<p class='c003'>Of course, much of the snow which falls on the
mountains does melt and run off in streams. Sometimes
the rivers flow rapidly down steep slopes.
Sometimes the water tumbles over a high rocky bank
and falls hundreds of feet to land below.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
The people of the north lands have put some of
the falls to work. For years the falling water has
turned wheels that have run mills to grind grain and
to saw logs. But now the water of some of the great
falls has been turned into electricity. High in the
mountains are large houses where the water is made
into the new power. From the power-houses electricity
is sent for miles and miles to light homes and
to run machines in factories. Norway has no coal.
The Norwegians turn the water into heat and power
such as coal makes. Sometimes people in Norway
call the waterfalls their “white coal.” So waterfalls
are also mountain giants.</p>

<p class='c003'>People who visit Norway and its mountains are
almost sure to come away believing in giants—but
not <em>fairy-tale giants</em>.</p>

  <h2 id='story06' class='c008'><b>In the Land of Evergreen Trees</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Near the Christmas season the mountain forests
of Norway and Sweden become a fairyland of ice
and snow. Then the forest rings with the sounds of
voices and the blows of the axes of boys cutting trees
that will be decorated for the Yule-tide feasts in
their homes. And thousands and thousands of pretty
little trees are cut at that time of the year.</p>

<p class='c003'>Eric and Hubert are Swedish boys who live in that
land of evergreen trees. Their father owns a farm
in the northern part of Sweden, but he works nearly
all the year round in the forests. Eric, who is twelve
years old, often helps his father in the forest. Hubert
is only nine, and too young to work with the trees;
but he goes with his father and Eric many times to
play about in the woods and to watch the others at
their work.</p>

<p class='c003'>During the winter the men cut down the big trees
and saw them into logs which are easy to handle.
Then Eric helps stack the logs as they fall from the
saws.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
But when spring comes Eric is one of the busiest
workmen. The strong woodcutters load big logs on
to sleds to be hauled to the river bank a mile away.
Eric drives the horse which hauls his father’s logs
to the river. Often Hubert rides with Eric. The boys
sit on the big logs on the sled as the horse pulls them
along through the snow on the mountain road.</p>

<div id='img13' class='figcenter'>

<a href='images/img13f.jpg'><img src='images/img13.jpg' alt='' class='ig015' /></a>
<p>EVERGREEN TREES IN WINTER</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The logs are unloaded at the river bank. Soon the
river will be flowing rapidly with much water from
the melting snows from the mountains. Many farmers
will then float logs in the same stream; therefore
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
at the river bank each of Eric’s logs must be marked
so that his father can claim them at the end of the
waterway. Sometimes Hubert stays by the river bank
to watch the men who work for his father place his
father’s mark on each of the logs. The mark is the
initials E. K. in a circle.</p>

<p class='c003'>The boys enjoy seeing the logs go tumbling down
the swift-flowing rivers. They have often stopped at
a spot below where the river spreads out into a lake.
When the logs reach that spot they stack in the
water. Men then go along with poles to keep the
logs moving. Sometimes there are acres and acres
of logs in the lakes of Sweden at one time.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Swedish and Norwegian people make many
things of wood—their ships, their houses, their furniture,
their bridges, their telephone poles, and many,
many other things. But many of the logs which are
floated down the river from that mountain forest
where Eric works are made into paper.</p>

<p class='c003'>Eric and Hubert have been to the factory which
stands near the bank of the waterway which carries
their logs. Thousands of men work there. They put
the logs through a mill which grinds them into coarse
fibers. Those shreds are then mixed with water and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
chemicals to make a pulp. The pulp is pressed under
heavy rollers and dried to make sheets of paper—newspaper,
writing paper, wrapping paper, and cardboard.</p>

<p class='c003'>One day when Hubert was lighting a fire with a
safety match, his father told him that the wood of
the match had come from the big trees of the forests
too. A Swedish man found the way to make safety
matches. And Sweden was the first country to make
the matches that will not catch fire unless the head
of the match is scratched on a certain kind of rough
paper. He told Hubert, too, that safety matches
from Sweden are used all over the world.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the school which Eric and Hubert attend the
boys are taught to plant trees. And every spring
they plant little trees to take the places of the big
trees which the woodmen have cut down.</p>

<p class='c003'>The school boys learn that about one fourth of
Norway’s land and about one half of Sweden’s land
are covered with trees. But they are taught too that
the people can use up the supply of trees that Nature
has given them. So they help obey the laws of their
country which require that trees be planted to keep
the forests from being destroyed.</p>

  <h2 id='story07' class='c008'><b>How the Mountain Was Clothed</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A Norwegian story-teller wrote a story “How the
Mountain Was Clothed.” This is his story:</p>

<p class='c003'>Through a deep cut between two mountains, a
river hurried down over the rocks. The mountain
walls on either side were high and steep. But one
side of the mountain was bare. But at the foot even
of this side, and so near the river that it was bathed
in its spray, stood a cluster of trees. They gazed upward
and outward, but they could not move one way
or another.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
“Suppose we clothe the mountain,” said the juniper
to the fir.</p>

<p class='c003'>The fir looked up at the naked mountainside and
replied, “If any body is to do it, I suppose it will
have to be we.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The fir looked over toward the birch and asked,
“What do you think, Birch?”</p>

<p class='c003'>The birch glanced up the bare mountainside. The
wall leaned over so that it seemed to the birch as if
it could scarcely breathe. “Yes, indeed, let us clothe
it,” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
So the three took upon themselves the task to
clothe the bare mountain. That was their goal, and
they soon set out to see whether they could reach
that goal. The juniper went first.</p>

<p class='c003'>When they had gone but a little way, they met the
heather. The juniper seemed to want to pass it by.
“No, take it along,” said the fir. So the heather
joined them.</p>

<p class='c003'>Before long the juniper began to slip, “Take hold
of me,” said the heather. The juniper did so, and
whenever the smallest crack could be seen, the heather
put its finger into it. Wherever the heather had first
pried in a finger, the juniper put a whole hand. They
crawled and crept, the fir working hard, the birch
always behind the rest.</p>

<p class='c003'>“This is a noble work,” said the birch.</p>

<p class='c003'>The mountain began to wonder what kind of creatures
these might be that came clambering up its
side. And after it had thought the matter over for
a hundred years or two it sent a little brooklet down
to find out. As it happened, the brook went at the
time of the spring floods. It crept down till it met
the heather. “Dear, dear heather,” said the brook,
“won’t you let me pass? I am so tiny.” The heather
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
was very busy, so merely raised itself a bit, and
worked on. The brooklet slipped in underneath and
away.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Dear, dear juniper, won’t you let me pass? I am
so very little.” The juniper eyed it severely, but
since the heather had let the brook slip by, the juniper
might do that too.</p>

<p class='c003'>The brook raced on down the hill, and came to
where the fir stood puffing, out of breath, on the hillside.
“Dear, dear fir, won’t you let me by?” begged
the brook, “I am so very small,” and kissed the fir
on the foot, and smiled. The fir let it by.</p>

<p class='c003'>And the birch made way for the brook, even before
it was asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Hi, hi, hi!” said the brook and grew. “Ha, ha,
ha!” said the brook and grew larger. “Ho, ho, ho!”
said the brook, and tore up the heather, the juniper,
the fir, and the birch by their roots and flung them
pell mell, head o’er heels, down the steep slope of the
mountain.</p>

<p class='c003'>The mountain sat for several hundred years after
that and smiled at the memory of that day. It was
plain to be seen: <em>The mountain did not want to be
clothed.</em></p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
The heather fretted and worried until it grew
green again, and then it set forth once more. “Courage!”
said the heather.</p>

<p class='c003'>The juniper half raised itself to get a good look
at the heather. So long did it sit half raised that at
last it sat upright. It scratched its head, set forth
again, and dug in so hard for a foothold that it
seemed surely the mountain must feel it. “If you
won’t have me, then I will have you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The fir stretched its toes a bit to see if they were
all right, raised first one foot and then the other,
and finally both feet at once. It first looked to see
where it had climbed, next where it had been lying,
and finally where it was to go. It then went on its
way, pretending it had never fallen.</p>

<p class='c003'>The birch, which had soiled itself badly, got up
and brushed itself off. Away they went, faster than
ever, to the sides and straight up, in sunshine and
in rain.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What can all this mean?” asked the mountain,
one fair day, all glittering with dew, as the summer
sun shone down upon it, the birds sang, the hare
hopped about, and the woodmouse piped.</p>

<p class='c003'>The day finally came when the heather could peep
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
over the top with one eye. “Oh dear, oh dear!” said
the heather, and away it went.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Dear me,” said the juniper, “what is it the heather
sees?” and just managed to reach high enough to
peer over. “Oh dear, oh dear!” it exclaimed and was
off.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What is it the juniper’s up to today?” the fir wondered,
taking longer steps in the heat of the sun.
Before long it rose on its toes and peered over. “Oh
dear, oh dear!” Its branches and needles rose straight
up on end.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What is it all the others see and I don’t?” the
birch asked, as it carefully lifted its skirts, and
tripped after them. “Oh—oh—! If there isn’t a huge
forest of fir and heather and juniper and birch already
on the other side of the mountain waiting for
us!” it exclaimed. The glittering dew rolled off its
leaves as it quivered in the sunshine.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Ah, that’s what it means to reach our goal!” said
the juniper.</p>

  <h2 id='story08' class='c008'><b>Reindeer Land</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Reindeer land! Surely the land of the far, far
north in Norway and Sweden may be called reindeer
land.</p>

<p class='c003'>One man who traveled in that land tells of a
strange sight he saw there. On snow ahead of him
one day he saw something moving. It looked as if
thousands of hares were playing in the snow. They
seemed to jump, or leap, into the air and to come
down in the same spot. But why should so many
hares be there? And why did they move so strangely?
The man went closer, and found that his <em>hares</em>
were reindeer tails! Yes, just tails! And thousands
of them! The bodies of the reindeer were buried in
the snow and just the stubby tails stuck out. The
reindeer had dug into the snow, throwing up a bank
which hid their bodies from sight. They were eating
the moss which they found under the snow and
happily wagging their tails as they ate.</p>

<p class='c003'>The reindeer are about the only animals that can
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
get a living in those mountains where little grows
except moss. And the people, called Lapps, who roam
about with them get their living from the reindeer.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Lapps are small people. The men and women
are not much taller than most ten-year-old boys and
girls. They have yellow skin, blue or gray eyes, and
brown hair. They dress in the skins of the animals
or in coarse cloth. They look very much like the
Eskimos.</p>

<p class='c003'>The word <em>Lapps</em> means <em>people at land’s end</em>. And
that part of Norway and Sweden which lies at their
very tops is called Lapland. Most of the Lapps wander
about, following the reindeer. Wherever the reindeer
find plenty of moss, the Lapps pitch their skin
tents, or build themselves a hut of sod covered with
brush. In those huts they and their wolf-like dogs
live until the reindeer begin to wander farther away.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Lapps and their dogs sleep together in the
huts on beds which are heaps of brush covered with
reindeer skins. Getting ready for bed is a simple task
for these people. They merely take off their moccasins
and lie down to sleep in their clothes. They wear
the same clothes, too, for months and months and
very seldom take a bath.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
A kettle of reindeer meat is always boiling over
coals on rocks in the center of the hut. The Lapps
get food from the kettle whenever they feel hungry
and eat it with spoons made of reindeer horn from
rude bowls or plates of wood or bone.</p>

<div id='img15' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic017'>
<a href='images/img15f.jpg'><img src='images/img15.jpg' alt='' class='ig017' /></a>
<p>LAPPS TRAVELING WITH REINDEER</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Day and night some Lapp and his dogs watch the
herd of reindeer as they wander on the mountains.
A few reindeer are kept near the hut to furnish milk
for the camp.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
The reindeer not only furnish the skins for clothes
and covers and milk and meat for food, they are also
the Lapps’ horses. The Lapp children like to go
sleigh riding behind a reindeer. But sometimes the
ride is rough. The children may be thrown out into
the snow. The reindeer wears but little harness, so
the driver cannot hold him if he cares to run.</p>

<p class='c003'>Several families of Lapps go every summer from
Sweden across a body of water to a place in Norway
where the moss on the mountains is very good. The
reindeer swim across the water. The Lapps go in
boats and join the reindeer on the other side.</p>

<p class='c003'>One Lapp family that crosses the water from
Sweden has built a hut of timber for its summer
home in Norway. It is no larger than the skin or sod
huts. Both the mother and the father have to stoop
to enter the house. But the little Lapp girl and her
dogs can run in and out easily.</p>

<p class='c003'>But, even though the Lapps move about from
place to place, the Lapp girls and boys go to school.
The law of Sweden requires these children to go to
school for six years. They begin their lessons when
they are seven years old and go to school until they
are thirteen. Each settlement has its own school. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
schoolhouse is just another Lapp hut. In the summer
the children study their lessons sitting on the
ground in front of or in the hut. The teacher lives in
the hut and moves when the camp moves. Many of
the teachers are Lapps who have been educated to
teach; but some of the teachers are Swedes or Norwegians.</p>

<div id='img16' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic018'>
<a href='images/img16f.jpg'><img src='images/img16.jpg' alt='' class='ig018' /></a>
<p>A LAPP HUT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The children must learn both the Lapp language
and the Swedish language, if they live in Sweden.
They learn both the Lapp language and the Norwegian,
if they live in Norway. First they learn to read,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
write, and work with numbers. After they can read
and write a little, they begin other lessons. They learn
about the plants and animals of the north land. They
learn how to raise and care for the reindeer. They
are taught, too, how to care for their own bodies—how
to bathe, brush their teeth, cook their food, and clean
their huts. But they do not learn those lessons of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
cleanliness and care of the body well, because their
mothers and fathers do not practise them in the
homes. Perhaps in a few years when the Lapp children
grow up they will be cleaner than their mothers
and fathers are. At least that is what the teachers
hope.</p>

<div class='ic019'>
<a href='images/img17f.jpg'><img src='images/img17.jpg' alt='' class='ig019' /></a>
<p>CHILDREN IN A LAPP SCHOOL</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The Lapps make trinkets of reindeer horns and
bone, moccasins of the skins and plaited grass, and
dolls dressed as Lapp children dress. When the boats
which carry tourists along the seas of Norway come
near the camp, the Lapps go to meet the boats.
They carry with them bags of the trinkets to sell
to the people from other countries who are on the
boats.</p>

<p class='c003'>In Sweden many Lapps ride on the trains. Sometimes
they carry boxes filled with trinkets which they
have made. They put them in shops that sell such
wares to visitors in Sweden. If you rode on a train
across the northern part of Sweden, you would see
many Lapps, and you would see their trinkets in the
shops—bone letter-openers, fur moccasins, fur mittens,
dolls dressed in fur.</p>

<p class='c003'>Not all Lapps follow the reindeer. Some of them
live in one place all the year and earn a living by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
fishing and farming. Their homes are not much better
than the huts of the wandering mountain Lapps, but
they dress much like their Norwegian and Swedish
neighbors. These people are called Sea Lapps.</p>

  <h2 id='story09' class='c008'><b>Through Farm Lands of Norway</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As Roald climbed into the two-wheeled buggy beside
his mother and sister Annie, he was too excited
to speak. If only his father would let him drive the
pretty dun-colored horse hitched to the buggy!</p>

<p class='c003'>Roald knew little about horses. He lived in Oslo,
a city in Norway. He had never owned a pony of his
own, and really had never visited in the country
where boys ride and drive horses.</p>

<p class='c003'>Early that spring his father had said, “This summer
we will take a vacation and go through the farm
lands of Norway.” For weeks Roald waited for the
day when that journey could begin.</p>

<p class='c003'>Then one day in July the journey did begin. The
family left Oslo by train. But to Roald the journey
didn’t really begin until they left the train at a small
town miles from the city and climbed into that two-wheeled
buggy which Norwegians called a <em>cariole</em>.</p>

<p class='c003'>The dun-colored horse took them only a short way.
For most of their journey was to be on small steamboats
on the waterways of Norway, called fjords, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
by automobiles on mountain roads. But Roald gladly
climbed on the boat.</p>

<p class='c003'>Their first boat glided along narrow waterways for
miles and miles between mountain walls that in some
places rise almost straight up from the water. Roald
began to wonder whether this could be a part of Norway’s
farm land. But now and then, even in this
mountainous region, his father pointed out a lone
farmhouse perched up on the mountainside.</p>

<p class='c003'>Soon the boat passed shores that were less steep
and Roald saw stretches of low and rolling land between
mountain peaks. He caught glimpses of farms
lying close together. This farm land was like the
farm land he had seen near Oslo.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
Roald wondered what farmers grew in this land of
mountains and water. But he did not need to leave
his boat to see some of the farmers’ products. As the
boat stopped at a small town along the fjords to deliver
the mail and boxes of foodstuffs, boys came on
deck to sell baskets of fruit—cherries, raspberries,
blueberries, currants, and apples.</p>

<div id='img18' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic020'>
<a href='images/img18f.jpg'><img src='images/img18.jpg' alt='' class='ig020' /></a>
<p>A TWO-WHEELED BUGGY OR CARIOLE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>After a day on the fjords, the family traveled in an
automobile. Roald soon asked, “What are those
strange fences we see everywhere in the fields?” But
he needed no answer to his question, for in a few minutes
he saw one of those fences loaded with grass.
All along the way he saw men, women, and children
in the fields making hay. The men cut the grass and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
the women and girls and boys helped rake it into
small stacks and hung it on the fencelike frames to
dry in the sun.</p>

<div id='img19' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic021'>
<a href='images/img19f.jpg'><img src='images/img19.jpg' alt='' class='ig021' /></a>
<p>A FENCE LOADED WITH GRASS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>They saw farmers cutting grass on slopes that
are covered with rocks. The farmers used scythes
and hand sickles to cut around the many rocks. Farmers
in many countries would call such rocky hillsides
waste land, but in Norway no blade of grass can be
wasted if the cattle are to be well fed during the
winter.</p>

<p class='c003'>Roald looked up at one place and saw a big bundle
of grass dangling in the air. “Oh, Father, look!” he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
cried. And his father smiled as he said, “You must
not be surprised to see bundles moving along over
your head. Farmers who live on the mountains send
hay, baskets of berries, buckets of milk or butter
down to the valleys on strong wires which have been
stretched down the mountain slopes.” And in a few
minutes Roald saw a woman hang a bundle of hay
on a wire and start it sliding down to the barn below.</p>

<p class='c003'>At one place the automobile stopped for an hour.
Roald and his father took a walk. Back from the
road were a farmhouse and the barns of a large farm.
They walked along a narrow road up to the house.
They saw people at work in the fields. In one field
a man was raking grass. He was riding on a rake
behind two horses. Other men were loading the grass
on a low-wheeled wagon to haul it to the barn where
it would be hung on the fences to dry. In another
field girls were gathering potatoes which the men
had dug.</p>

<p class='c003'>Far back across the field was a wire pen which
caught Roald’s eye. At first he thought that he was
looking at a chicken house. But as he walked closer
he saw that foxes and not chickens lived in the pen.
What cunning foxes they were! Baby foxes lay
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
sleeping in the sun. Other foxes ran about the pen,
jumping up on the box houses and off as they pleased.
The foxes had long black fur. Down the back of each
fox was a stripe of fur tipped with white. Such animals
are called silver foxes because of the white tips
on the black fur.</p>

<p class='c003'>At first Roald felt sorry for the baby foxes. He
imagined that they were unhappy and longing to be
free to run away into the woods. But his father said,
“These foxes have never lived anywhere except in
this pen. They are well fed, and, no doubt, are very
contented in the pen.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Farmers in this northland often raise foxes for
sale. The silver foxes are very valuable. People pay
large prices for fox furs and they like the pretty silver
tips on them. Ships that sail from Norway to
other countries carry many fox pelts to those other
lands.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
But Roald soon forgot the foxes as he watched
some boys busily working in another field. Rows of
poles were sticking in the ground in that field and
bunches of grain hung on each pole. The boys were
pulling up the poles, turning them around, and sticking
them back into the ground.</p>

<div id='img20' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic022'>
<a href='images/img20f.jpg'><img src='images/img20.jpg' alt='' class='ig022' /></a>
<p>A NORWEGIAN FARM</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Roald watched them for some time. From one
of the boys he learned that grain in that part of Norway
is usually dried on poles. By the time the oats,
barley, and rye are ripe enough to cut summer is
nearly over. The wet fall weather begins. The grain
must be dried as quickly as possible. Stacking it in
shocks on the ground would not do, for the rainy
weather would rot it. The farmers in Norway fasten
their grain on short poles to hold it up off the wet
ground.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
The grain on one side of the poles which Roald saw
had received more sunshine than the grain on the
other side of the poles. That is why the boys were
in the field turning the poles. They wanted all the
grain on the poles to dry quickly.</p>

<p class='c003'>Roald was surprised to see other boys cutting small
shrubs and branches of trees and hanging them on
fence posts to dry. What would they ever do with
those dry leaves? But his father told him that if he
stayed on the farm during the winter he would see
the goats eating the dried leaves and liking them
too. And most farmers in Norway keep goats as well
as cows, horses, and pigs.</p>

<p class='c003'>Roald and his father and his mother and sister
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
then rode on a bus to the next town. They did not
travel very fast, for the bus driver is also the mailman.
He stopped at each farmhouse along the road
for which he had mail. Sometimes he dropped the
mail in a mail box by the side of the road, but often
girls or boys were waiting at the farm gate to take
the mail. Often the driver gave a sack full of mail to
a farmer or a man who runs a small store in a village.
That man delivers mail to the families who
live farther back off the main road.</p>

<p class='c003'>At one place the man who was to take a sack of
mail was not outside his house to meet the bus. The
driver and all the passengers on the bus were impatient.
The driver honked the horn of his car, but
still the farmer did not come. Then the bus driver
went over to a post by the gate and pushed a button.
He told Roald that by pushing that button he rang
an electric bell at the farmhouse. So Roald was not
surprised to see the postman come running after the
bell had been rung.</p>

<p class='c003'>Roald was ready to take the train back to Oslo
after a week in the country, but he talked about the
farms all the rest of the summer.</p>

<p class='c003'>Dotted here and there far up in the mountains
stand lonely little huts. For months during the year,
the roofs of those huts are covered with snow and
no smoke comes from the chimneys. But as soon as
the winter snows are gone and the tender green grass
covers the mountain slopes, the girls take the cattle
to the mountains to feed on the fresh grass. Those
girls will live in the lonely huts until the snows of

<p>LONELY LITTLE HUTS IN THE MOUNTAINS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Sometime in June many girls start on the journey
to a saeter. The girls look forward to that day for
weeks even though they will be very lonely up in the
mountains. Anne and Hulda are sisters who go to
a saeter each summer. Anne is only fourteen years
of age and Hulda is seventeen. Sigrid, who is about
the same age as Hulda, and Martha, who is much
older, live on a farm not far from the farm where
Anne and Hulda live. Anne, Hulda, Sigrid, and
Martha take their cows to the same saeter. So the
four girls live together for three months each summer.</p>

<p class='c003'>One summer, Anne, Hulda, Sigrid, and Martha
started for the saeter on June 25. They live in a part
of Norway that is far from a fjord or a railroad, so
they had to travel on foot. They did not go alone,
for there was too much to take to the saeter. Their
older brothers went with them. The girls dressed in
heavy brown khaki suits and high-topped shoes,
walked ahead with the cows, the sheep, and the goats.
The boys came behind them with horses loaded with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
food, churns, milk cans, bedding, and cooking vessels.
At first they traveled along a main road and
walking was easy. Only a few miles from their
homes, they stopped for a week at a house near the
road. The cows ate the grass off the mountain slopes
near the house, and the boys planted potatoes on a
patch on the mountainside which was level enough
that crops would not be washed away.</p>

<p class='c003'>At the end of the week they again loaded the
horses and started on the rest of their journey. To
reach the high pastures, they must walk up a narrow
zigzag road. The small dun-colored horses climb the
paths carrying the bundles. What a lot of turns the
road has! One mountain path has twenty-seven
turns. Of course, the many turns make a longer road
than a straight one would be, but the girls are glad
for the zigzags. They make the road less steep and
they follow the smoother paths.</p>

<p class='c003'>By the end of the day, the cattle reached their
green pastures. And the girls opened the hut which
was to be their home for almost three months. The
hut was made of rough timber. It had a sod roof on
which grew grass and small shrubs.</p>

<p class='c003'>The boys helped the girls clean the hut which had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span>
been closed for so many months. They unloaded the
goods which the horses had carried up the mountain
and put everything in place. In one corner of the
one big room, they put the churn, the milk cans, and
the tools. In another corner was a fireplace. On it
they hung iron kettles on which the girls would cook
their food and boil the milk to make cheese. On a
table at one side of the room they put the crocks for
the milk and on a shelf above the table, they placed
the dishes. At one end of the room on wooden beds,
they put the mattresses of straw and warm covers
which look like small feather beds.</p>

<p class='c003'>The next morning the boys set out down the
mountain again. They must return to help gather
the grain and cut the grass on the farm. The girls
are left alone with the cattle.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
All four of the girls got up early each morning.
They milked the cows and the goats. After breakfast
of cheese and bread and butter and milk, Anne and
Sigrid each morning took the cattle to the pasture.
While the cattle wandered about on the mountain
eating the fresh grass, the girls lay in the sun or
searched for wild berries—blueberries, raspberries,
and blackberries.</p>

<p>A NORWEGIAN SAETER</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Each evening Anne and Sigrid called the cattle.
They knew each one by name, and perhaps some of
their cows were named Rose, Birchen Bough, and
Morning Pride like the cows in the old rhyme. They
drove the herds back to the barns near the hut and
went home for supper.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
Hulda and Martha had supper ready. They had
smoked herring, goat’s cheese (goat’s cheese is dark
brown in color and tastes sweet), potatoes, bread,
butter, milk, and fresh berries. Hulda and Martha
were busy all day. They took care of the milk,
cleaned the house, and walked two miles to the main
road to meet the postman who passes in the afternoon
each day. One day each week they got the
milk ready for the man who came to take it to factories
where butter and cheese are made.</p>

<p class='c003'>The girls were glad when Saturday nights came.
Then some of their relatives and friends came out to
see them. Girls from other saeters came too if they
were not too far away. On these nights sometimes
the girls and boys sang songs and danced on the
grass.</p>

<p class='c003'>Ole, Kristian, and Sofie are other Norwegian girls
who take cows to the high pastures. They live on a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
farm near a fjord. They take their cattle part way
up to the saeter on a boat. The girls, dressed in dark
dresses and heavy shoes, carrying big knapsacks on
their backs, travel on the same boat with the cows.
When they leave the boat, they drive the cows a few
miles up the mountain. They live much as Anne,
Hulda, Sigrid, and Martha live on their saeter.
These girls can go to the village by boat to buy groceries.</p>

<p class='c003'>Automobile roads have been built in some parts of
the high mountains. Tourists climb the high mountains
in automobiles. Round and round they climb,
sometimes on a road that is like a shelf sticking out
from the rocky wall. And here and there they may
go right through the wall itself, for holes, or tunnels,
have been cut through the rocky banks.</p>

<p class='c003'>Tourists who travel through those mountains are
glad to find a hotel at a saeter on their way where
they can get food or stay over night. And hotels
have been built at saeters which are near the automobile
roads. The hotel is a large wooden building.
It stands near the huts which are the homes of the
family which cares for the cattle.</p>

<p class='c003'>Matti, Ingrid, and their brother Ole go each
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
summer to a large saeter called Grotli. Their father has
a hotel there. Grotli means “Goat’s Hill,” and
Grotli looks like a goat’s hill in the summer when
the goats run about on the mountain.</p>

<div id='img23' class='figcenter'>

<p>MATTI, INGRID, AND OLE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Early in the spring Matti, Ingrid, and Ole, and
their father and their mother move to Grotli. Sometimes
the snow is still on the ground when they
arrive. Then the children may think that Grotli
looks more like reindeer hill. A farmer, who lives near
the saeter, has a herd of tame reindeer. They wander
about on the mountain. They rub the snow out of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
the way with their noses and eat the fresh grass and
moss which they find underneath.</p>

<p class='c003'>Sometimes visitors in Norway ask, “Why must the
cattle go so far away from the farm to the high pastures?”
If they ask a Norwegian milkmaid, she
might say, “The grass which grows on the farm
must be saved for winter feed. Not enough grass
grows on the farm for both summer and winter.
Fresh, tender grass grows on the high mountains, so
the cattle eat it in the summer. Then no grass is
wasted.”</p>

<p class='c003'>But the milkmaid may not know why the saeter
is <em>so far</em> away from the farms. And, of course, it
does seem strange to American girls and boys that a
farmer sends his cattle to feed in high pastures miles
from his farm, while in the mountains just above his
own farm graze the cattle of another farmer who
lives miles away. Why cannot a farmer graze his
cattle on the mountains near his home? The answer
to that question is a story of long, long ago in Norway.</p>

<p class='c003'>Long ago the farmers in Norway found that they
must use the grass on the high mountains for summer
feed. The king said, “Each farmer may have a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
part of the grass lands on the high mountains for
his pasture. But each farmer must use only a certain
amount of land and he must find a place which no
other farmer has already claimed.”</p>

<p class='c003'>So each farmer hunted himself a mountain pasture.
When he found a space which he liked, if it
had not already been claimed, he drove stakes into
the ground to mark it off. He put his name on the
stakes and then the land was his. Many farmers had
to take pasture lands which were far from their
farms. They could find no other free land.</p>

<p class='c003'>Years and years have passed since the days when
a farmer drove stakes and marked off his pasture
land. The farms have passed to other owners. Perhaps
now the great-great-great-grandsons of some of
the farmers live on the farms, or some farms may
have been sold to other families. But the new owners
of the farms are also owners of the same saeters that
the old farmers staked off for the farm. And that is
why many a farmer today takes his cattle to a saeter
far from his home.</p>

  <h2 id='story11' class='c008'><b>On the Flat Farm Lands of Denmark</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One day late in July, Christian was so excited he
could hardly eat his dinner. School had closed for
the summer vacation. The next morning Christian,
who was only nine years old, was going to a farm to
stay four whole weeks. In fact he would stay on the
farm until time for school to open again in August.</p>

<p class='c003'>Christian lived in the largest city in Denmark.
We call that city Copenhagen, but Christian calls it
Kjøbenhavn (Kuvn havn). Christian was not the
only boy in that city who was excited on that July
day. Many boys, and girls too, were leaving the city
for a summer on a farm.</p>

<p class='c003'>They were not going to visit aunts or uncles or
grandfathers. No, their visits were going to be more
exciting even than visits to aunts and uncles and
grandparents would be, for many of them were going
to be guests of families whom they had never seen.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
Those boys and girls live in very poor homes in
the city. When school closes for summer vacation,
there is little for them to do. Their homes are small
and there are few places near their homes where
they can play. So every summer farmers invite boys
and girls from the city to be their guests for four
weeks of their vacation. The officials of the railroads
and of steamship lines give those boys and girls free
rides on the trains and boats to the farms.</p>

<p class='c003'>Perhaps Christian was happier than many of the
boys. Only a few weeks earlier a letter had come to
him from the farmer whom he had visited the summer
before. The letter said, “All of us here on the
farm want you to come to us again this summer. I
think that even the cows, the chickens, the ducks,
and the geese missed you when you left last August.”
No wonder Christian was excited and happy!</p>

<p class='c003'>Morning came at last and Christian started very
early on his journey to the farm. He carried only a
small bag of clothes with him, so he and his mother
went to the station on a street car. He passed
through the gate at the station and waited on the
platform for his train. Other boys and girls were
waiting too. Soon they were on the train scrambling
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
for seats by a window for they were eager to see as
much of Denmark as they could.</p>

<p class='c003'>Christian had almost a whole day’s journey to the
farm. Denmark is made up of hundreds of small
bodies of land with water separating them. To reach
the farm Christian had to travel on two trains and
two boats.</p>

<p class='c003'>Christian was interested in all that he saw. He
was not surprised to see the wide stretches of flat
land, but after visiting farms of Norway you may be
surprised. Christian saw a field in which black and
white cows were eating the green grass. He could see
far, far away across that pasture. The land was as
level as a floor, with not even a tiny hill in sight.</p>

<p class='c003'>At other places he did see hills—no very high ones
though. That hilly land looks very little like land of
Norway made by the giants. But the same ice-sheets
did make these hills. As the glaciers that covered
Denmark melted, they left behind these piles of
rocks and soil which we call hills.</p>

<p class='c003'>Some sights which Christian saw are much like
the sights in the land of the Dutch children. The
land of Denmark is flat like Holland, so the Danes
have long made the wind work for them just as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
Dutch have done. So Christian saw windmills which
still pump the water off the low lands or grind the
farmers’ grain.</p>

<p class='c003'>Denmark has many small farms. Many of the
farms have even less than two acres. A piece of land
so small as that in America would hardly be called
a farm. Of course Denmark has large farms also.
But Christian saw many of the small farms as he
rode across the country. The farm buildings form
three sides of a square. Many times the buildings
are of red brick and the roof of straw woven into a
covering called a thatched roof.</p>

<p class='c003'>The farmer was at the train to meet Christian.
They rode out to the farm in a wagon behind two
bay horses. After what seemed to Christian a very
short ride he was opening the gate to the farm and
could see the white farmhouse and barns far back
across the fields.</p>

<p class='c003'>Then began happy days for Christian. He liked
the big light room at the top of the clean white house
which was his own, but he liked best the big out-of-doors.
He drank all the milk he wanted. He ate potatoes
with heaps of butter, and eggs, and cheese,
and sausages, and bread.</p>

<div id='img24' class='figcenter'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
But Christian worked too. One of his tasks was to
help gather in the eggs. The baskets were so quickly
filled with eggs that the farmer took them to town
twice each week. Christian went with him. They
took the eggs to a large building where eggs are
packed for shipping. Such a lot of eggs in that
building! Christian wanted to know what the workmen
did with the eggs and before the summer was
over he had learned.</p>

<p class='c003'>Some of the workers sorted the eggs, putting the
big ones in one box, the middle-sized ones in another,
and the small ones in another. Other workers tested
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
them to see whether they were fresh. The fresh eggs
were sent to other workmen who stamped on each
egg in red the word “Danish” with a red line around
it.</p>

<div id='img25' class='figcenter'>
<a href='images/img25f.jpg'><img src='images/img25.jpg' alt='' class='ig027' /></a>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Christian asked, “Why do you put ‘Danish’ on the
eggs?”</p>

<p class='c003'>The workman said, “Many of these eggs are sent
away from Denmark to other countries. We put the
word ‘Danish’ on the eggs so that people will know
that the eggs come from Denmark. Then if they like
the eggs, they will know where to send for more. If
they find bad eggs, they can tell us.”</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
Then the workman showed Christian some sheets
of paper on which he kept records. From those
sheets he could tell just what farmer brought in each
box of eggs. He said, “You see, Christian, we keep
such good records and each farmer keeps such good
records that if a customer gets a bad egg, we can find
the very hen that laid that egg.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Christian knew that the workman was only joking,
but the workman did know the date when the
egg was laid. Christian knew too that the farmers
knew which hens lay many eggs, and which hens lay
large eggs.</p>

<p class='c003'>Christian learned to milk cows too. He could milk
only a little, as his hands got tired. He milked only
cows that were easy to milk. But he could carry
buckets of milk to the house.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the large stable where the cows are milked,
Christian saw a sheet of heavy paper tacked up over
each stall. He read what was on some of those
papers. They were the cows’ <em>grade cards</em>. There
were good grade cards too, for they told exactly what
each cow can do—how much each eats, how much
milk each gives, whether that test is better or worse
than other tests.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
Christian felt sorry when the farmer showed him
one record. That record was for a cow that was eating
a great deal, but giving milk that tested low in
butter fat. The farmer said that he would have to
fatten that cow and use it for meat.</p>

<p class='c003'>Christian went with the farmer to take big cans of
milk and cream to the cheese factory and the creamery.
The factory was in an old, old town. Christian
liked to play on the narrow street near the factory.</p>

<p class='c003'>But he always went with the farmer to take the
milk and cream to the factories. Over those buildings
he saw a word that he asked the farmer about.
The word was the Danish word that means “Co-operative.”
The farmer told Christian the “co-operative”
means that the farmers are working together
for the good of all. So instead of each farmer making
cheese and butter on his own farm and selling it
at whatever price he wishes, a group of farmers take
their milk and cream to factories where cheese and
butter are made for them. There the milk and cream
are tested and each farmer is paid a fair price for
his cans.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the cheese factory were cheese balls marked
with the word “Danish” in the oval just as the eggs
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
were marked. The man at the cheese factory said,
“We put the name ‘Danish’ upon <em>good</em> cheese only.
Anybody in any country may be sure that cheese
marked ‘Danish’ has been tested before it is sold.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Christian began to feel that it was a splendid idea
to have the name “Danish” put upon only <em>good</em>
products. In that way people everywhere would
come to trust their country. The farmer told him
that the idea was the same for each person. He said
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
that Christian could make his own name stand only
for good things. He said, “See to it always that the
work upon which you write your name is the very
best work that you can do.”</p>

<p>A CO-OPERATIVE DAIRY FARM</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>One day Christian went to visit a farm that had
eight hundred acres. Eight hundred acres is a large
farm even in America where there is much land, and
is, of course, a very large farm in a small country
like Denmark. On that farm Christian learned more
about the word “co-operation” which means “working
together for the good of all.”</p>

<p class='c003'>On that big farm the farmer works with a college
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
which teaches young people how to run a farm. The
young men who do the work on the farm for the
farmer are studying with the college teachers how to
farm. The young women who cook the meals and
take care of the house are also studying with college
teachers how to cook and care for a house.</p>

<p class='c003'>Christian had already decided that he wanted to
be a farmer when he was old enough. Now he
thought he wanted to study how to be a good farmer
on that large farm which worked with the college.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span>
  <h2 id='story12' class='c008'><b>A Teller of Tales</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Almost every one has read the story of The Ugly
Duckling. In the story, the little duck just out of the
shell looked about him and said, “How wide the
world is!” And his mother replied, “This is not all
the world. The world stretches far across the garden,
quite into the parson’s field.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Now that duck might have lived in the back yard
of a small house in the town of Odense, which lies
in the center of an island in the middle of Denmark,
with water all around it. That is where the man who
wrote the story of The Ugly Duckling lived. That
man was Hans Christian Andersen.</p>

<p class='c003'>The boy Hans might have been that Ugly Duckling
himself. At least the world in which he lived was
as hard for the boy as the poultry yard was for the
duck. Hans’s father was a poor man who made and
mended shoes for a living. He died when Hans was
only eleven years old. Hans’s mother washed clothes
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
for other people, to earn money enough to buy food.
As she stood on the river bank washing, Hans sat by
and dreamed his dreams of fairy people. Perhaps
that is where he saw Thumbelina sailing on a water
lily.</p>

<div id='img28' class='figcenter'>

<a href='images/img28f.jpg'><img src='images/img28.jpg' alt='' class='ig030' /></a>
<p>THE BIRTHPLACE OF HANS ANDERSEN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Other boys made fun of Hans. So the lonely boy
made playmates for himself in his dreams. He made
the darning needle walk and talk; his tin soldier
became a great hero. He cut fairy figures out of
scrap paper.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span>
But Hans dreamed other dreams too. He wanted
to do great things in the real world. His mother
said, “You must go to work to earn money. The
tailor will let you work in his shop.” Hans was unhappy
at the thought of sitting on a stool all day
sewing and sewing. So he left the town of Odense
and went to the big city of Copenhagen. He said,
“I’ll go on the stage and act parts in plays.” And he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
tried to act, but he was so awkward that he never
could act well. Then he said, “I’ll sing beautiful
songs on the stage.” But the teachers said that his
voice was not good enough.</p>

<p class='c003'>He made some friends in the city. They helped
him get money to go to a good school. By that time
he was older than the other young people studying
at the school. They were not friendly to him. So
once more he forgot his loneliness by dreaming
dreams, and writing the stories he dreamed.</p>

<p class='c003'>Many, many children love the Snow Queen, and
the Little Match Girl. Hans Christian Andersen
wrote the stories about them. He wrote many, many
other tales too and won even greater fame than he
had ever dreamed for himself.</p>

<p>PAPER CUTTING DONE BY HANS ANDERSEN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>He travelled much in other lands. Everywhere he
went he found children reading his books or listening
to his tales. Some men would have felt very
important to have so much fame. But Hans Christian
Andersen said, “When I see how far my thoughts
have flown, I am frightened. I wonder whether I
have kept my thoughts pure enough for so many
children to read them.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Little did he dream just how great was his fame.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
He wrote those fairy tales more than a hundred
years ago. And even today no stories are more loved
by children all over the world than the stories by
that great teller of tales.</p>

<p class='c003'>But perhaps the children of Denmark hear the
most about the man who wrote those tales, for he
was born in their country. A few years ago, the children
of Denmark celebrated the one hundredth anniversary
of the birth of Hans Christian Andersen.
At the schools they acted the stories that Andersen
wrote. In Copenhagen movie cameras took pictures
of the plays acted by the school children. Those pictures
are still shown to many children in Denmark.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the town of Odense still stands the house where
Hans Christian Andersen was born. The people of
Denmark have built a building beside that old house
in which to keep the things which belonged to Andersen.
The street in front of that house looks much
the same as it looked when the little boy, Hans,
played there.</p>

<p class='c003'>On the shelves in Andersen’s old home are his
fairy tales in Danish, in English, in French, in Spanish,
and in other languages too. Andersen wrote the
stories in the Danish language, of course. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
people in other lands wanted their children to read
those wonderful tales too. So the stories have been
rewritten in nearly every language in the world.</p>

<p class='c003'>When children visit that building, they like to

was writing his tales. Many children like, too, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>

those paper cuttings lie in a glass case, and beside

<p class='c007'>From the deck of a boat nearing Norway, Harold,
an eight-year-old American boy, watched the rocky
shores. Harold’s father too was watching those
shores. He was eagerly looking for familiar sights in
the town where he had been born.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
Harold was going with his father and mother to
visit his grandmother who lives in Norway. She
lives in the very same home in which Harold’s
father had lived when a boy.</p>

<p class='c003'>Harold had crossed the Atlantic on one of the big
steamships that carry travelers from the United
States to countries across the seas. He had left that
steamship at a port in England. After a day’s ride
on a train, he had boarded another boat to cross the
North Sea to Norway.</p>

<p>THE CITY OF BERGEN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
In a few hours after the shores of Norway came
into sight, Harold saw the buildings of a town built
in the midst of mountains. His father told him his
grandmother lived in that town. It was Bergen
(bear gen) which is surrounded by seven mountains.
The houses of the town were all along the side of
one of the big mountains and along the lower banks
of the sea. Harold’s father was as happy as a boy to
see again the red-tiled roofs of those houses among
the green trees of the mountain slope.</p>

<p class='c003'>The sun was shining when the boat pulled into
dock at Bergen, but the captain told Harold to have
his raincoat, rubbers, and umbrella handy, as rain
might fall any minute. He said, “A year has three
hundred and sixty-five days and rain falls in Bergen
on three hundred and sixty days. That leaves only
five clear days for Bergen in a year.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Harold’s father said that rain did not fall quite so
often as the captain said. But he told Harold that
records show Bergen’s rainfall to be six times as
much as the rainfall in the town where Harold lives.
And Harold’s town gets enough rain each year to
keep the grass green and to make the plants grow
well.</p>

<p class='c003'>Harold stopped along the water front to see the
fishing boats which were standing there. Men and
women were selling fish from more than a hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>93</a></span>
boats and from stands along the street near the boats.
They sold cod, herring, and halibut. Harold’s father
said, “Bergen is the largest fishing market in the
world. The fish are brought to Bergen in boats which
fish far to the north of Bergen in the waters of the
Arctic.”</p>

<p class='c003'>But they hurried away to grandmother’s house.
Harold was eager to see the grandmother whom he
had never seen. Grandmother was eagerly waiting
for her visitors too. She showed Harold a room
which was to be his room for the summer.</p>

<p class='c003'>The room was small. Both the walls and the floor
were painted light brown. A small bed of wood stood
in one corner. Over the clean white sheets, Harold
found a soft quilt. The quilt was so fluffy and thick
that Harold thought it must be a small feather bed.
His grandmother said that the quilt was stuffed with
down taken from the nests of eider ducks.</p>

<p class='c003'>Harold enjoyed the warm cover each night, for
even in summer the nights in Bergen are cool. But
that soft quilt was hard to keep in place, no matter
how carefully it was tucked in.</p>

<p class='c003'>A tall narrow stove stood in one corner of the
room. Harold did not need a fire, but he found a box
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
of wood beside the stove ready for a fire when the
cold days came.</p>

<p class='c003'>In a few days, Harold knew his way around the
old city of Bergen. Sometimes he walked along narrow
streets between rows of wooden houses. Some
of the houses are very, very old—even more than
six hundred years old.</p>

<p class='c003'>Some of the shops which Harold passed were on
wide streets. Both the shops and the streets look
much like shops and streets in American towns. Of
course some shops sold raincoats, umbrellas, and
rubbers. Other shops sold articles which the Norwegians
think visitors from other lands will like. On
the walls of those old shops hang bright-colored rugs
woven on a hand loom. One day Harold saw girls
dressed in old Norwegian costumes weaving a rug.</p>

<p class='c003'>Harold bought a gift for his mother in one shop.
It was a tiny Viking ship made of silver with a
dragon’s head at its prow. Inside the ship was a little
spoon. The shopkeeper said that the little ship was
made to hold salt for the table. Harold bought himself
some woolen mittens. They were very warm
mittens made from the wool of the sheep of Norway—white
sheep and black sheep. The mittens were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
white with black figures on them. The shopkeeper
said that Norwegian women who live in the country
knit or crochet the mittens and weave the rugs during
the winter when they cannot work in the fields.</p>

<p class='c003'>Sometimes Harold did not get home at the right
time for meals. His grandmother thought that queer
for any boy. She said that Harold’s father had always
been ready for every meal when he was a boy.
But at first Harold just couldn’t remember what
were the right hours for meals at grandmother’s
house. He was always on time for the first breakfast,
which was served very early. He ate bread and
butter and drank milk, while his grandmother, his
mother, and his father ate bread and butter and
drank coffee. But Harold often forgot the second
breakfast, which grandmother served at ten o’clock.
Then to grandmother’s surprise he would come into
the house at twelve o’clock expecting lunch. He got
a lunch of course, and then might forget that dinner
was served at three o’clock. Grandmother did not
scold one bit though, and in a few days Harold
learned to be on time for every meal. He liked
grandmother’s tea, which she served at eight o’clock
each evening. He always asked for some thick brown
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
goat’s cheese to eat with his bread and butter as he
drank his tea.</p>

<p class='c003'>How pleased grandmother was when Harold went
over to her after a meal, kissed her on the cheek, and
said, “Tak for maten.” He was saying, “Thank you
for the food,” as his father had taught him to say it.
All polite girls and boys in Norway, Sweden, and
Denmark say, “Thank you for the food,” to their
mothers after a meal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span>
  <h2 id='story14' class='c008'><b>In a City Built on Islands</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One day Harold and his father left Bergen to visit
Harold’s cousin Albert who lived in Stockholm, the
capital city of Sweden. They traveled for a day and
a night on a train.</p>

<p class='c003'>The train crossed Norway on Norway’s longest
railway which passed through the high mountains.
The electric train climbed the mountains easily and
Harold saw that part of Norway which his storybooks
call “the home of the giants.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Then the train left Norway and crossed Sweden.
Harold thought the farms in Sweden looked much
like the farms around his home in Minnesota. The
fields were large. The houses were far apart. Sometimes
the train went for miles before Harold saw a
farmhouse.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Harold reached Stockholm he saw a city
which to him looked much like any other city. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
his cousin Albert said, “You will get your best view
of Stockholm from high above the city.” So he took
them to the top of a tall tower and they looked down
on the city. “What a queer city it is!” said Harold.
“It is spread out over many islands.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Then Albert told Harold how Stockholm came to
be built where it is. Albert had learned about the
building of the city at school.</p>

<p class='c003'>The city was built nearly seven hundred years ago.
A rich nobleman planned the city in the days when
many pirates sailed on the Baltic Sea, the sea which
Stockholm faces. The nobleman wanted to build a
fortress for protection from the pirates. All along
the sea coast were islands—hundreds of islands. The
nobleman chose three small islands back from the
sea with many other islands in front of them and
built a wall around them. He thought that behind
the wall his people would be safe from the pirates.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
A town grew up behind the wall. The days of the
pirates passed. Stockholm became a city of trade.
It grew and grew. Buildings spread over other islands
until today the city covers a dozen islands in a
large lake which opens into a channel of water which
flows to the sea.</p>

<div id='img33' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic035'>
<a href='images/img33f.jpg'><img src='images/img33.jpg' alt='' class='ig035' /></a>
<p>THE CITY OF STOCKHOLM</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>And Harold and Albert looked down on that city
and watched the boats coming and going on the
many waterways.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
Albert took his guests to a little home outside the
city. “This is where we live in the summer,” he said.
Harold thought the place looked like a tiny city of
playhouses, but as they came nearer he saw that the
playhouses were real homes.</p>

<p class='c003'>Harold’s aunt met them at the door of one of the
cottages. It had two rooms and a porch. Vines and
rose bushes grew over the porch. All the other cottages
were much like the one where Albert lived.</p>

<p class='c003'>Around each house was a garden spot. Albert said,
“These are our ‘little farms.’” Albert does most of the
gardening on his “little farm.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The summer home though does not belong to Albert.
The city owns those garden spots. A few years
ago many countries of the world were at war. Sweden
could not get the food from other countries that
she needed. Stockholm began then the plan of renting
garden spots to its citizens, so that they might
grow the food that they needed. The plan proved
so good that the city kept the garden spots after the
war was over. And Albert’s father rents a little farm
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>
for Albert each summer. He pays a very small sum
for the use of the garden and cottage for the entire
summer—a sum equal to about five dollars in American
money.</p>

<div id='img34' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic036'>
<a href='images/img34f.jpg'><img src='images/img34.jpg' alt='' class='ig036' /></a>
<p>ONE OF THE SMALL SUMMER HOMES</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Albert showed Harold the vegetables, fruit, and
flowers which he was growing on his farm. “In the
fall,” he said, “I’ll take my best specimens to the fair
in the city. I’m sure to get a prize for some of them.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Each day after Albert had hoed his garden, he and
Harold went to play with the other boys who also
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
lived on little farms. One day they went to the lake
to swim and to ride on the rafts. The boys had made
the rafts of logs. Between the two logs at each end
of the rafts they had fastened a board for seats. Albert
rowed the raft on which he and Harold rode
while they rested from their swimming. Harold only
laughed and swam away again when Albert tipped
the raft and threw him into the water.</p>

<div id='img35' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic037'>
<a href='images/img35f.jpg'><img src='images/img35.jpg' alt='' class='ig037' /></a>
<p>THE BOYS WITH THEIR RAFTS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>One morning the boys went to the city again.
They walked through the streets toward the quay—the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span>
place where the boats land. Harold noticed that
all the buildings were of white stone. He knew that
Sweden, like Norway, was a land of many forests.
Why then were there so few wooden houses? He
asked Albert. His cousin told him, “The first city
was built of wood, but fires came and destroyed the
homes. People kept building of wood for many years,
but again and again fires destroyed the homes. Wood
is not Sweden’s only building material. Under the
soil around Stockholm is a fine building stone called
granite. So the buildings you see in this new city
are of granite.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The boys stopped along the street to visit a flower
market. It was bright with many colors. For in that
city so far north many flowers grow. In the market
place were pinks, violets, sweet peas, roses, asters,
dahlias, and long-stemmed gladioli.</p>

<p class='c003'>About noon the boys got on a boat at the quay to
go to the King’s palace. The palace of the King
stands in an old part of the city. It is on one of the
islands where the old wall stood so long ago. Near
the King’s palace are a few streets of old buildings
with sharp gabled roofs. That part of Stockholm is
called “the city between bridges.” Day and night
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span>
boats pass under the bridges and move along the
water in front of the palace.</p>

<p class='c003'>The boys reached the palace about noon. Albert
wanted Harold to see the changing of the King’s
guards. As they neared the palace, they heard sounds
of band music. In the courtyard beside the palace,
they saw a line of guards dressed in uniform such as
guards of the palace have worn for hundreds of years.
Then the line of marching men came into sight. The
band in uniform marched first, then the guards who
were to take the place of those guards now at the
palace. They crossed the bridge and entered the
courtyard. The guards drilled for a few minutes at
the command of the officer. The band played more
music. Then the commander told the new guards
what their duties were and the old guards marched
away, leaving them to protect the king and his property.</p>

<p class='c003'>The next day Albert was going on a long hike with
his Boy Scout troop. The scout leader said that
Harold could go with them. Early in the morning
the boys gathered near the water front to wait for
their leader. Soon Harold felt at home with the
group of boys wearing khaki suits and carrying
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
knapsacks even though he could not speak their
language. Many of the boys could speak a little English
and they talked to Harold in his language.</p>

<div id='img36' class='figcenter'>

<a href='images/img36f.jpg'><img src='images/img36.jpg' alt='' class='ig038' /></a>
<p>CHANGING THE GUARD IN FRONT OF THE ROYAL CASTLE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The scouts hiked several miles that day. They
stopped on the grounds of an old, old castle. In a
few minutes tents were pitched for the night.</p>

<p class='c003'>The leader took them into the castle, which had
been built hundreds of years ago. They went to the
banquet hall of knights of old. Harold had never
seen such a beautiful room. The walls were covered
with paintings of kings and knights. The ceiling was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
of gold. The boys stood before the King’s throne
and imagined a page kneeling there to be dubbed a
knight. They could almost hear the words, “I dub
thee knight. Be ever true to your country. Be ever
strong; protect the weak; and do good deeds.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Then outside on the courtyard of that old castle,
the scouts took their oath—not unlike the one the
knights of old had taken so many years ago. They
too pledged obedience to the laws of their country.
They promised to be strong and to go forth to do
good deeds day by day.</p>

  <h2 id='story15' class='c008'><b>The Children of the North Celebrate</b></h2>
</div>

<div class='c010'>1. <span class='sc'>The Yule-tide</span></div>

<p class='c003'>Long, long ago, so the old stories of the North say,
frost giants who lived on the mountains wanted to
keep the earth in darkness and cold, and the gods
who lived in the valleys fought with the giants to
keep sunshine and warmth on the earth.</p>

<p class='c003'>Early in January each year when the nights were
longest, the people in the old days said, “Yule, the
frost giant, has won in the battle against Odin, the
god of the sun.” Now the people knew that Odin
would win the next battle, which was always fought
in the middle of the summer when the days were
longest; therefore they celebrated Yule’s victory in
the happy thought that Odin would soon triumph
over the frost giant. They lighted fires and made
feasts which lasted for weeks. And so began the
Yule-tide celebration which the children of those
northern lands today celebrate each year.</p>

<p class='c003'>After years and years, the people who lived in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
these lands became Christians. They began to celebrate
the day the Christ-child was born. As the
years passed, the Christmas celebration and the Yule
celebration came to be one big feast time.</p>

<p class='c003'>The weeks before Yule time are busy weeks. The
houses must be cleaned. Cakes, cookies, and bread
are baked. Sausages are made. Girls are sewing on
gifts and boys are sawing and pounding, making
gifts too. The stores in the cities and towns are
bright with decorations and happy buyers crowd
about buying gifts.</p>

<p class='c003'>The day before Christmas comes at last. And for
the girls and boys of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark
the day before Christmas is a merrier day even
than Christmas Day. Everybody is up early on that
day. A tree of spruce or fir is set in place in the living
room. No home is too poor to have a yule-tree
in that land of evergreen trees. Norway and Sweden
have enough trees in their forests to supply every
home, and ships carry trees from their forests to the
children of Denmark.</p>

<p class='c003'>As soon as the Yule-tree is up the merriment begins.
The girls and boys help decorate the tree with
strings of bright paper, painted cones from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span>
evergreen trees, colored ornaments, and red candles, or
bright electric lights. The boys place a big log in the
fireplace ready to brighten the room with its glow.</p>

<div id='img37' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic039'>
<a href='images/img37f.jpg'><img src='images/img37.jpg' alt='' class='ig039' /></a>
<p>CHRISTMAS BRINGS SKIS FOR OLD AND YOUNG</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Another tree is then decorated in the yard for the
birds. The boys set up a large branch of a tree and
help the girls tie bunches of oats and barley upon it
so that the birds will have their Yule-time feast.</p>

<p class='c003'>After lunch the girls and boys stay away from the
Yule-tree. But how excited they are! For it is then
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
that secret packages are heaped on the floor underneath
the branches of the tree. Darkness comes early
in the northern parts of these countries at Christmas
time. In the far north the sun never shines at this
time of the year. As early as three o’clock, Mother
lights the tree and Father starts the Yule-log burning.
Then all the family gather around the tree and
the best fun of the day begins. Those children do
not have to wait until Christmas morning to see their
gifts. The packages are passed out as soon as the
tree is lighted on Christmas Eve. Under the tree are
presents for everybody—dolls, toy trains, books,
knives, skates, sleds, skis, and candies and nuts and
many, many other gifts too.</p>

<p class='c003'>After the gifts are unwrapped sometimes Father
and Mother and the children and the servants join
hands and sing carols around the tree. By that time
the dinner is ready. And that dinner is one of the
best of the year with fish, potatoes, peas, flat bread,
sausages, ham, or maybe a goose, pudding, and cakes.
The children are tired and ready for bed at an early
hour.</p>

<p class='c003'>The next morning they are up early again. While
it is quite dark they go to church for a Christmas
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
service. Pretty Yule-trees stand beside the altar and
the children carry gifts for the poor and place them
beneath the Yule-trees. They sing songs, repeat
their prayers, and listen to the pastor’s story of the
Christ-child.</p>

<p class='c003'>Christmas Day is a quiet day in most of the homes
in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. But after Christmas
is over the merrymaking begins again. There
are more feasts and parties. The children skate, and
ski, and coast on their sleds as much as they please,
for school is closed during the whole of the Yule
season.</p>

<div class='c010'>2. <span class='sc'>Mid-summer Eve</span></div>

<p class='c003'>American girls and boys sometimes dance around
a Maypole and crown a queen on the first day of
May. The girls and boys of Norway, Sweden, and
Denmark have a midsummer holiday when they too
dance around a gaily decorated pole, but they are
not celebrating the coming of May. They are greeting
the long summer day.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the long ago people believed that June twenty-third
was the day on which Odin, the sun god, won
in the fight against the frost giants. So they danced
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
and sang in praise of Odin. And people of those
lands have kept up the old custom.</p>

<div id='img38' class='figcenter'>

<a href='images/img38f.jpg'><img src='images/img38.jpg' alt='' class='ig040' /></a>
<p>DANCING AROUND THE MAYPOLE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The school children of one Swedish town were gay
and happy on the twenty-third of June. The big
boys set up a tall pole in a field near the schoolhouse.
Then a crowd of girls and boys tied branches
of fir, spruce, and pine on the pole. They put bright
flowers among the green branches.</p>

<p class='c003'>When the pole was bright with the evergreen and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>
flowers, a troop of girls and boys came from the
schoolhouse and played games on the grass around
the Maypole. But the greatest fun would come after
dark. So early in the afternoon they hurried home
to dress in their gayest costumes to be ready for the
frolic that night.</p>

<p class='c003'>Grown-ups came to the night celebration too. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
dance lasted far into the night, for all through those
northern lands there is no darkness on the midsummer eve.
The sun shines all through the night
in the places far to the north, but even in the southern
part of Sweden where these children live, the
sun was gone but a few hours. During those hours
while the sun was gone, the sky was almost as bright
as day with twilight.</p>

<div class='c010'>3. <span class='sc'>An American Fourth of July in Denmark</span></div>

<p class='c003'>In one town in Denmark, some girls and boys are
as eager for the Fourth of July as American girls and
boys are. For, like many American girls and boys,
on that day they are going to a picnic in a park. Yes,
they are going to a <i>Fourth-of-July</i> picnic and a picnic
as much like an American picnic as they can
have. About the only things missing from their picnic
are firecrackers. The law of Denmark will not
permit firecrackers.</p>

<p class='c003'>The park is called <i>The American National Park</i>.
The bands play patriotic American music. The
people sing American patriotic songs, “The Star-Spangled
Banner” and “America.” Speakers tell
about America and how our country won
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>115</a></span>
independence. The Stars and Stripes float in the breeze with
the Danish flag of red and white. People play ball
and run races. They eat lunches from big lunch
baskets.</p>

<p class='c003'>One American visitor asked, “Who are the people
celebrating our Independence Day?” If you asked
that question at the park, and a Danish boy answered,
the answer would be, “This is the Danish-American
Club.” Have you ever heard of Danish-American
clubs in America? The members of Danish-American
clubs in America are people who have come from
Denmark to live in America. The Danish-American
Club in Denmark is made up of Danish people who
have lived in America at some time and Danish
people who have relatives living in America.</p>

<p class='c003'>Svend is one boy you might meet at a Fourth of
July picnic in Denmark. Svend was born in the city
of Chicago in the United States. His father and
mother were both born in Denmark, but they lived
in America about ten years. Svend’s father studied in
the United States and learned to be a librarian.</p>

<p class='c003'>Svend was only four years old when he went to
Denmark to live. Of course Svend could speak English
then. But when he was old enough to go to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
school, he began speaking Danish all the time. His
father wanted him to speak English at home so that
he would not forget the English words. Svend said,
“Oh, if I speak English, the boys call me a <em>foreigner</em>.”
Svend was only seven years old when he said
that. When he is older he will study English in the
schools of Denmark. Then perhaps he will be proud
that he can speak English easily.</p>

<p class='c003'>Svend’s father takes care of a library for the Danish-American
Club. In his library are many, many
books telling about how Denmark and America work
together. Some of the books are written in Danish
and some are written in English. Both Danish-American
clubs in Denmark and Danish-American
clubs in America give money to support the park
and the library.</p>

<p class='c003'>Svend’s father is glad to take Svend to the Danish-American
picnic on the Fourth of July each year,
for he wants Svend to love America, the land where
he was born.</p>

<p class='c003'>Karl is another boy at the picnic. He is fifteen
years old. He speaks English very well from his
study in school. Karl’s family go to the Fourth of
July picnic because Karl’s uncle lives in America.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
Karl writes to his cousins in the United States.
From them he has learned many things about our
country.</p>

<p class='c003'>Travelers in Denmark sometimes go to the Fourth
of July picnic. They cannot feel strange on that
picnic ground with the many American flags and
the American songs.</p>

his Yule-tree than his eyes lighted on a big package
standing behind the tree. “Skis,” he thought, “surely
no other present could make such a huge package.
But was <em>his</em> name on that package?”</p>

Olaf lost no time in opening the prize package. His
eyes shone as he saw the new skis. At last he had a
pair of skis fit for any ski-jumper!</p>

<p class='c003'>Olaf had often watched ski-jumpers leap in the
air like a bird and land safely on runners many feet
away and go sliding gracefully down a steep hillside.
Now he too could learn to be a ski-jumper!</p>

<p class='c003'>Like most children of Norway and Sweden, Olaf
had learned to run on skis when he was very young.
By the time he had started to school, he could run
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>119</a></span>
very well. On that Christmas morning, Olaf’s little
sister, only three years old, got a pair of skis too.
Olaf gave her the first pair of skis he had used and
she played in the snow on them, while Olaf tried
his larger and finer pair.</p>

<p>OLAF’S LITTLE SISTER</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Skiing is the favorite play of the boys at Olaf’s
school. Near the school are skiing grounds where
Olaf and his classmates play at recess time. At first,
of course, those boys ran on small hills. Then they
practised on longer slopes. Olaf’s father had said,
“You must know how to handle your skis well before
you begin ski-jumping.” Now Olaf did know how to
run well on skis and he had the best kind of skis for
jumping.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
Olaf lives in Norway and nowhere in the world do
people have better skiing grounds. The snows come
in November and stay until March or April, and the
mountain slopes make long skiing tracks. The
weather too is good for skiing. Although the weather
is cold enough to keep the snow for many months,
the cold is not severe enough to keep sport lovers
indoors.</p>

<p class='c003'>Skiing is not merely a child’s sport in Norway.
Olaf’s father and mother both ski. Many business
men and their wives ski; farmers and their wives
ski; the King and Queen ski. Norwegians and the
Lapps of the far north often travel on skis. Such
travel is easy. With knapsacks filled with food and
strapped to their backs, travellers make long
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>121</a></span>
excursions in a short time. So Olaf lives in a country
which might truly be called, “the home of the skis.”</p>

<div id='img41' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic043'>
<a href='images/img41f.jpg'><img src='images/img41.jpg' alt='' class='ig043' /></a>
<p>IN BOTH NORWAY AND SWEDEN SCHOOL CHILDREN LEARN TO SKI</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The first Sunday after that Christmas when Olaf
got his new skis, Olaf, his father, and his mother
went to a long skiing ground about a five-mile ride
from their home in Oslo. They left their home very
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
early in the morning. They stood in line with many
other men, women, and children waiting for the
train. What a queer crowd it was! Sticking up over
each head were the points of skis which looked like
stubby trees. No wonder one passer-by said the
sight was like “a forest of a thousand trees.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Then the train came with a special car to carry
the skis, and the merry crowd was off for the day.
Olaf got his first lesson in ski-jumping.</p>

<p class='c003'>But it was in February that Olaf got his greatest
treat of the year. Oslo is near the bottom of the long
narrow country and on the side away from the sea.
The land around Oslo is hilly but the slopes are not
very steep. One mountain for skiing is about an
hour’s ride on an electric car from Oslo. On this
mountain the youths of Norway gather in February
each year to hold a skiing contest. So in February
Olaf and his parents with thousands and thousands
of people from all over countries of the north went
to see the ski-jumping contest.</p>

<p class='c003'>The jumpers gathered at the top of the long
mountainside. Each contestant wore a number fastened
across his chest telling his place in the contest.
At a signal from an officer number one ran down
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span>
the hill to a bank of snow called the “take-off” station.
When he got to the “take-off,” he jumped into
the air. Olaf watched him breathlessly. Yes, he
landed on his feet. The crowd cheered heartily. An
officer ran out with a measuring rod to see how far
he was from the “take-off” when he landed on his
feet again.</p>

<div id='img42' class='figcenter'>

<p>A SKI JUMPER</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Then the other jumpers came in turn. Several
failed to land on their feet. But most of them
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_124' id='Page_124'>124</a></span>
laughed with the people looking on over their failures
even though they must have hated badly to lose.</p>

<p class='c003'>The longest jump that day, and the longest that
had ever been made at that time, was two hundred
and thirty-five feet. That is a long jump, but, no
doubt, some of the schoolboys who were watching
the jumpers will beat that record in a few years.
Some of Olaf’s playmates were able then to jump
eighty feet. They are eagerly waiting to be old enough
to enter the big contest.</p>

<p class='c003'>The boys learned much by watching expert ski-jumpers.
One of their favorite jumpers is the King’s
son, Prince Olaf. Prince Olaf was in the big contest
several times when he was a young man. The boys
often saw Prince Olaf on skis. One day the Prince
stopped where Olaf and his playmates were practising
and told them how to hold their feet to make a
safe landing. Olaf never forgot what the Prince said.
And he was glad too that his mother had named him
<em>Olaf</em>.</p>

<div class='c010'>2. <span class='sc'>With the Skaters</span></div>

<p class='c003'>A line of skaters on a waterway of Sweden was set
for a race. The skaters looked more like huge white
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>
birds than the young boys they were. Each skater
wore heavy skates and held tightly to a frame of a
large white sail.</p>

<div id='img43' class='figcenter'>

<a href='images/img43f.jpg'><img src='images/img43.jpg' alt='' class='ig045' /></a>
<p>SAIL SKATING</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Away they flew over the smooth ice! The strong
wind which blows over the lands carried them along
swiftly. Most of the boys were skillful in guiding
their course with the wind and keeping on the clear
ice. But here and there a skater had trouble. One
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span>
skater was tossed to the bank; another was sent
sprawling on the hard ice, for the wind does not deal
too gently with those who cannot follow its path.</p>

<div id='img44' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic046'>
<a href='images/img44f.jpg'><img src='images/img44.jpg' alt='' class='ig046' /></a>
<p>SLEDS ON THE ICE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>When the race was over, the winner was hoisted
in the air and cheered. The skaters went their way
to try again another day.</p>

<p class='c003'>Skaters in Denmark use sails too. The flat lands
have such strong winds that sail skating is great
sport for Danish children. But even in the flat lands
of Denmark there are days when the sail skaters are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
disappointed. They gather for a race to find no wind
that day; and, of course, no wind means no race.</p>

<p class='c003'>But sail skating is only a part of the skating fun
in those northern lands. Children all over Norway,
Sweden, and Denmark skate during the winter
months. In many places playgrounds are flooded to
make safe skating grounds for the girls and boys. On
the safe ice even the tiny girls and boys slide on the
ice and ride on the chair-like sleds which are pushed
along by the larger girls and boys.</p>

<p class='c003'>The children of those northern lands learn early
that outdoor sports help to build strong and healthy
bodies.</p>

  <h2 id='story17' class='c008'><b>At School in the Far North</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As the clocks struck eight one Monday late in
August the big gates to the school grounds swung
open. With a shout waiting boys ran through one
gate to a playground which they had not seen for
several weeks. Crowds of girls ran through a gate
to another playground on the other side of that same
schoolhouse.</p>

<p class='c003'>That August day was the first day of school for
girls and boys in nearly every city and town in Norway,
Sweden, and Denmark.</p>

<p class='c003'>Girls and boys who live in those countries do not
have such long summer vacations as have American
girls and boys. Many of them go to school until the
first of July and come back to school again in the
last week of August. They go to school more days
each week, too, than do American children. They go
to school on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span>
They start to school each morning after a very
early breakfast. In winter all the children of Norway,
Sweden, and Denmark must dress and eat their
breakfast by electric lights, and go along the streets
to school while the street lights are still burning. Of
course, those girls and boys in the far northern part
of Norway and Sweden work by electric light in their
classrooms all the winter days.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>With such an early breakfast, the pupils are hungry
by the middle of the morning. They are given
a lunch time around ten thirty or eleven o’clock each
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
day. Many girls and boys eat a lunch at the schoolhouse,
but others go home for a lunch which they
call “breakfast” even though they had eaten an earlier
meal. The younger pupils go home from school
about one o’clock and the older pupils leave school
each day about three o’clock.</p>

more than do the school buildings in America.</p>

1. <span class='sc'>At School in Norway</span></p>

<p class='c003'>Harold lives in Oslo, Norway. He is in the third
grade. All the pupils in his room are boys and the
teacher is a man.</p>

<p class='c003'>The first day of school was a busy one for Harold.
When the boys were in the room the teacher
said, “Write your name on the paper which I shall
give you.” Harold wrote his name in clear letters.</p>

<p class='c003'>After the teacher got the names of all the boys
he said, “Now I shall tell you what lessons you will
have each day. You may write them down on a time
plan.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Harold and his classmates knew what a “time
plan” is. The storekeepers in the bookstores had
given them pretty picture cards with blank places
on them where the pupils could write the names of
the subjects and the time at which each would recite.
So when the teacher told them the lessons they
would have each day they wrote them on their time
plans. Harold’s time plan looked like the one shown
here.</p>

<p class='c003'>Most of the subjects the Norwegian girls and boys
study in the third grade are the same as those which
American pupils study in the third grade. American
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span>
girls and boys study English; but on Harold’s time
plan instead of English is <em>Norsk</em>. Norsk is the name
for the language of Norway.</p>

<p class='c003'>In one of the reading texts which many children
read the first picture is a flag of Norway. Across the
page from the picture is a poem about Norway. The
poem is in Norsk of course. Children in Norway
learn that poem so that they can say it without looking
at the words.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
On the seventeenth of May each year the Norwegian
girls and boys march through the streets carrying
flags and singing “Ja, vi elsker dette landet.”
The seventeenth of May to them is what the Fourth
of July is to us. It is their Independence Day.</p>

<p>NORWEGIAN CHILDREN CELEBRATING INDEPENDENCE DAY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>For many, many years Norway, Sweden, and Denmark
were governed by one king. But in 1905 Norwegians
became free to govern themselves. They
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span>
chose a king for their country. On the seventeenth
of May each year school children of Oslo and towns
near Oslo parade past the palace of the King. The
King watches their parade. The children stand very
quietly then while the King speaks to them about
Norway, their country.</p>

<p class='c003'>Harold’s sister is in the seventh grade. Her time
plan is shown on page 137.</p>

<p class='c003'>Many pupils in the seventh grade find English to
be their hardest subject. Only a few English words
are like Norsk words which they speak. On the time
plan you see the names of the days of the week—Mandag
(Monday), Tirsdag (Tuesday), Onsdag
(Wednesday), Torsdag (Thursday), Fredag (Friday),
Lørdag (Saturday), Søndag (Sunday). They
are much like English names for the days of the
week.</p>

<p class='c003'>Norwegian pupils soon learn the English word
“summer,” for the Norsk word is “sommer.” They
soon can say “come,” for in Norsk they say “komme,”
and “Many thanks” which in Norsk is “Mange
takke.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The Norwegians did not get words from the English,
however. The English got words from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
Norwegians. Long, long ago some people from these
northern lands went to live in the land of the English
people. From them the English learned to use some
of the old Norsk words and they have kept some of
those words in their language. English settlers
brought the English language to America, so Americans
too use those old Norsk words.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Norwegian pupils have a hard time learning
to pronounce words which have the letter “w,” for
“w” is not used in the Norsk language. The English
word “warm” is “varme,” “work” is “verke,” “wash”
is “vaske,” “window” is “vindue,” “west” is “vest,”
and “well” is “vel.”</p>

<p class='c003'>But, of course, many, many other English words
are not at all like Norsk words.</p>

<div class='c010'>2. <span class='sc'>In Swedish Schools</span></div>

<p class='c003'>Greda was very happy one morning as she went
to school. She carried a small bundle in her hand as
she hurried along. When she entered her classroom
she whispered to the teacher, “Today is my birthday.”
Then the teacher brought out a small stand
just big enough to hold the little Swedish flag which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>137</a></span>
Greda took out of her bundle. As Greda put the flag
into the flag holder, her classmates said, “Happy
birthday, Greda,” and sang a song to the flag.</p>

<p>A SEVENTH GRADE TIMEPLAN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In that Swedish school girls and boys study almost
the same subjects as the Norwegian girls and boys
study. When winter comes and snow covers the hills,
the skiing teacher comes to school every day. Now
skiing sounds like play, but it is a school study for
girls and boys in those North lands.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
Girls and boys of Norway and Sweden want to be
good ski runners and ski jumpers. They begin to
ski when they are very young. The young children
run only on small hills near the school. The older
girls and boys go out to longer mountainsides for
their practice.</p>

<p class='c003'>Of course many pupils get tumbles in the snow as
they learn to run on skis. The teacher says, “To be
a good ski runner, you must have courage to try,
and if you fail, you must laugh and try again.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Some children of the North lands go to school in
the summer too. But the summer school is very different
from the regular school. “Summer school is
much more fun,” Martha, a Swedish girl, said after
she had spent a summer in a camp and had studied
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
with a camp teacher. Her brother Nils likes camp
school too.</p>

<p class='c003'>Martha and Nils are twins. They were nine years
old when they went to the summer camp.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>That summer Martha picked gooseberries. She
learned to make gooseberry pie, gooseberry jelly, and
gooseberry preserves. Nils only helped to take the
stems off the berries, but he thought that was fun
when he worked with the other girls and boys of the
camp.</p>

summerhouses. That roof was of red tile. Nils carefully
measured and fitted each piece of tile into its proper
place.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nils helped some of the older boys to build a boat.
He had his first lesson in rowing in that very boat
too.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
But both Martha and Nils liked best the foot races
which the girls and boys of the camp ran every day.
Martha was the best runner of the girls and Nils
had a good record too even though he ran with boys
larger than himself.</p>

<div class='c010'>3. <span class='sc'>At School in Denmark</span></div>

<p class='c003'>If you were to see a group of school children in
a Danish town you would find that they look very
much like the Norwegian children and the Swedish
children. They look much like girls and boys in
America too.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>
Those children study about the same subjects that
the Norwegian and Swedish girls and boys study.
They study from books written in Danish. Danish
words and Norwegian words are alike in print, but
the Danes and the Norwegians do not pronounce
them alike.</p>

<p class='c003'>Since an island is a small body of land with water
all around it, and Denmark has so many islands,
many girls and boys in Denmark live near water.
Since there is so much water in Denmark almost all
Danish pupils learn to swim at school. They begin
swimming lessons when they first enter school.</p>

<p class='c003'>In Copenhagen, which is Denmark’s largest city,
the schools have swimming contests. On the day of
the contests classes from different schools gather at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
the water front. A high board wall has been built
around a part of the water so that the place for the
contests looks much like a pool. Mothers and fathers
sit on the platform near the walls and watch the contests.
Danish flags fly in the breeze. Everybody is
excited when the contest begins.</p>

<p class='c003'>The older girls and boys in the schools in Copenhagen,

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
month a librarian visits each school in the city to
take books to the pupils. She takes story books written
in Danish to the younger pupils. But to the older
pupils she takes books written in other languages
which they have studied. Some of the books are
written in French, some in German, and some in
English. Those Danish pupils read some of the same
stories that American pupils read in their libraries.</p>

  <h2 id='story18' class='c008'><b>In an Open-Air Museum</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Girls and boys always listen when grandfather begins
a tale with, “When I was a boy.” But many
times the girls and boys who listen to grandfather’s
tales find it hard to make pictures in their minds of
the houses grandfather tells about, of the games he
played, or of the dances he and grandmother danced.
And it is much, much harder to understand when
grandfather and grandmother tell the tales that their
grandfathers and grandmothers have told them!</p>

<p class='c003'>Many Swedish children go to a museum each year
to see how their great-great-great-grandparents actually
lived. For in that northern country—and in
Norway too—people have built museums which are
different from America’s big buildings with their
many showcases filled with things of long ago. They
have built what they call open-air museums.</p>

<p class='c003'>A Swedish man got the idea for such a museum.
One day more than sixty years ago that man, a doctor,
was far out in the country districts of Sweden.
There he saw old, old buildings with furniture like
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span>
the furniture used long, long ago. He saw people
dressed in costumes like those worn by their great-great-great-grandparents.
The doctor said to himself,
“Why not buy some of those old, old houses,
their furnishings, and the costumes of the people,
and put them where many people can see them?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Very soon after, the doctor began carrying out his
idea. Other people helped him. What a big task it
was! They brought together old houses, old churches,
old schoolhouses, old windmills, and other farm
buildings from all over Sweden. On a large piece of
wooded land outside Stockholm they rebuilt homes
and constructed whole farms as nearly as possible
like homes and farms of the long, long ago. That is
the way they made an open-air museum.</p>

<p class='c003'>One day a class of Swedish school children visited
an open-air museum. Very soon after they entered
the gate they saw a group of buildings. The buildings
were made of rude logs which have turned dark
brown with age in the sun and rain. The teacher
said that the group of houses belonged to one family.
The pupils asked, “Why did a family build a group
of houses so close together like this?”</p>

<p class='c003'>The teacher told them that in the early days a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>
family in Sweden usually had several houses. They
had a house with thick walls and thick roofs where
they lived in the winter. They had another house
with lighter walls and roofs where they lived in the
summer. They had a storehouse in which to keep
their food and fuel. They also had a guest house,
for in those days the people in Sweden gave their
guests a whole house to themselves.</p>

<p>A ROOM IN AN OPEN-AIR MUSEUM</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The pupils went inside one old, old house which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_148' id='Page_148'>148</a></span>
had been built about seven hundred years ago. It is
a one-story house with a sod roof. Inside the children
found furniture placed about the rooms as it
had been placed in those early days. But, of course,
there was little furniture. And strangest of all there
were no windows in the house. The light the people
could get from the sun came into the living room
through a hole in the roof above the center of the
room. That hole was just above an open fireplace.
Through it the smoke from the fire could escape. A
long pole hung from the hole into the room below.
On that pole was a thin skin which could be pulled
into place over the hole when the rains came.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the children saw other houses more like those
in which their grandfathers and grandmothers had
lived. In those houses the fireplace was built in the
corner of the room. They saw some fireplaces with
kettles hanging just as they had hung in the days
when a fire had blazed on the fireplace. In the room
were rude chairs cut from large tree trunks. On the
ceilings pictures had been carved and painted. The
children knew the stories which those pictures told,
for the stories were Bible stories which they had
read many times.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_149' id='Page_149'>149</a></span>
Some of the boys found an old bed which amused
them very much. It had three stories. The first story
stood out into the room about a foot farther than
the second story, and the second story stood out
about a foot farther than the top story. In that way
there were two steps up to the upper bed. The girls
and boys laughed, then the teacher lifted the lid into
the lowest bed and said, “This is where the cats and
dogs slept.” Then he showed them the inside of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>150</a></span>
middle bed and said, “This is where the children
slept.” The children then guessed that the top bed
was for the mother and father.</p>

<p>FOLK DANCING AT A MUSEUM</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>That afternoon the pupils went to see the folk-dances.
Some of their older brothers and sisters were
in the dances. They wore costumes such as Swedish
people long ago wore, they danced the dances that
were danced in those days.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
When the school children got back to their school
the next day, they wanted to dance some of the old
Swedish dances. The gymnasium teacher helped
them learn the steps, and the sewing teacher helped
them make their costumes. Then one day they
danced for their mothers and fathers and their grandmothers
and grandfathers.</p>

<p class='c003'>When the teacher of those children told them about
the man who had made the gift of the museum to
Sweden, the pupils agreed that the man who built
the open-air museum was a citizen of whom Sweden
may be proud.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>152</a></span>
  <h2 id='story19' class='c008'><b>A Tale of a Wandering Story-Teller</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose we pretend that we are in the feast hall
of one of the old guest houses of the Norsemen long,
long ago,” said one teacher to her children after they
had visited an open-air museum.</p>

<p class='c003'>Then as the teacher told the children about an
evening in a guest house such as they had seen at
the museum, they imagined people seated around
the long table eating from the rude bowls and drinking
from an old drinking horn, while they listened
to a tale told by a wandering story-teller.</p>

<p class='c003'>A story-teller in those northlands was an important
person in the old days before stories had been
written in books for people to read for themselves.
In those days, story-tellers went about from place
to place telling tales. They were always welcome
guests in any home, for people had little entertainment.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the very earliest days, people knew little about
why things happen as they do on the earth. They
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
did not know why we have day and night, or summer
and winter. They did not know why the rains
fall, or the lightning and thunder come. Since they
did not know the true reasons for these things, they
made up stories to tell why they happen as they do.
They said that many gods ruled over the earth. One
god, called Wodin, caused the day. Since day has
but one sun, Wodin had but one eye. The god Thor
caused the lightning and thunder. Another god ruled
over the summer, bringing the warm days when
plants could grow. He was called Frey. And the god
Tye ruled over war and brought victory in battle.</p>

<p class='c003'>We use the names of the four gods, Tye, Wodin,
Thor, and Frey, even today. From them we got the
names for four of the days of the week: Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—Tye’s day,
Wodin’s day, Thor’s day, and Frey’s day.</p>

<p class='c003'>Those early people believed, too, that huge giants
lived on the mountaintops and tiny dwarfs lived
under the ground. The old story-tellers told many
tales about fights between the gods and the giants.
One of the favorite tales was about Thor, the god of
thunder and lightning. The tale that Norwegian
teacher told her pupils was about Thor and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
Hammer. Her pupils listened almost as eagerly as those
old Viking families had listened around the feast
table hundreds of years ago.</p>

<div class='c000'><span class='sc'>Thor and His Hammer</span></div>

<p class='c003'>Thor lived in a beautiful palace in the valley of
the gods which lay between two mountains. Thor
had a beautiful wife with long golden hair. She was
called Sif.</p>

<p class='c003'>One day when Sif was sitting in the sunshine with
her long hair hanging down over her shoulders she
fell asleep. Loke, the god of mischief, passed by and
saw her. Now Loke liked to play tricks on Thor, and
when he saw Sif asleep, he thought, “Thor loves Sif’s
beautiful hair. He will be very angry if anything
happens to it.” Then he stole up, cut off Sif’s hair,
and carried it away with him.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Sif awoke, she was very unhappy. She ran
and hid herself. She did not want Thor to see her
without her hair.</p>

<p class='c003'>Soon Thor came. Sif was not there to meet him.
The strong god’s heart was filled with fear. What
was wrong with Sif? He ran quickly about the palace
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span>
to look for her. He found her weeping bitterly. When
he saw what had happened he was very angry. Fire,
like lightning, flashed from his eyes. The floors of
the palace trembled under his angry footsteps.</p>

<p class='c003'>“This is the work of that rascal, Loke,” he cried.
Then, like a thundercloud, he strode away from the
palace.</p>

<p class='c003'>He soon found Loke, and, no doubt, would have
choked him had not Loke promised to give back Sif’s
hair as beautiful as it had ever been.</p>

<p class='c003'>Now Loke knew some skillful dwarfs who lived
far underground. They made wonderful things of
gold. He hurried away to find them.</p>

<p class='c003'>When he came to their smithy, he asked, “Can you
make me a crown of golden hair which will grow
just as any natural hair grows?”</p>

<p class='c003'>These dwarfs were very clever. Of course they
could make such a crown. They set their fire ablaze
and began pounding with their hammers. In a short
time they had Loke’s treasure ready for him. But
that was not all they gave him. Two other gifts were
his. One was a magical spear; and the other a ship
that was more wonderful than any other ship the
dwarfs ever had made.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span>
Loke went back to the land of the gods carrying
his three gifts. When he reached that valley he began
bragging about the fine work the dwarfs had
done. “No other dwarfs can do such wonderful
work,” he said. “All other dwarfs are stupid compared
with these.”</p>

<p class='c003'>A dwarf named Brok heard Loke’s boasts. Now
Brok had a brother who was a clever workman too.
Many of the gods thought him the best workman of
all the dwarfs. Brok was angry when he heard Loke’s
bragging. He said, “My brother can make more
wonderful things of gold and iron and brass than
your dwarfs have made.”</p>

<p class='c003'>At that Loke laughed and laughed. “Go to your
brother,” he said; “if he can make three such precious
gifts as the golden hair, the spear, and the
ship, I will give him my head.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Brok at once went down to the underworld where
his brother lived. He declared that he would get
Loke’s head if any magic could be worked. He told
his brother what Loke had said. Soon that dwarf
was hard at work. In a few hours Brok started off
with a golden boar, a shining ring, and a mighty
hammer as his three gifts to the gods.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
When he reached the land of the gods he found all
the gods waiting to see what his gifts would be.
The gods appointed three judges to decide whether
Loke or Brok had the more wonderful gifts.</p>

<p class='c003'>Loke brought forth the golden hair and gave it
to Thor. Thor placed the hair upon Sif’s head. Behold
it began to grow, and again Sif was the beautiful
maiden she had been. Then Loke brought out
the spear and gave it to the judges. It was a spear
that never missed its mark. Then he gave the gods
the wonderful ship which would sail wherever its
master wished to go no matter which way the water
ran or what direction the wind blew.</p>

<p class='c003'>Loke was very proud of his gifts. Brok would
not have any treasures so fine.</p>

<p class='c003'>Then Brok came before the judges. He brought
out the shining ring. “This ring,” he said, “will
throw off many other rings as bright and shiny as
this one.” Next he brought out the boar, saying,
“This animal can run faster than the fastest horse.
On dark nights its bristles will shine so that the
night will be as light as day.” Then he gave Thor
the hammer. “This hammer,” he said, “will crush
whatever it strikes, and it will never fail to come
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
back to your hand no matter where you throw it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Thor took the hammer and swung it round his
head. Lightning flashed through the skies and peals
of thunder filled the air. The gods gathered round
to see the hammer. Surely such a hammer would be
the greatest protection against the giants. So they
said that the hammer was the greatest gift of all.
Brok had won.</p>

<p class='c003'>But how was Brok to get Loke’s head! He started
toward that young braggart. Loke growled, “I will
give you whatever you want, but not my head.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You promised your head, and your head I will
have,” answered the angry dwarf.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Come and get it,” shouted Loke as he ran away.
But when Brok told Thor what had happened, Thor
went and brought Loke back, for Thor always saw
to it that the gods did as they promised.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Cut off my head if you will,” said Loke, “but you
must not touch my neck. I did not promise you any
of my neck.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Then Brok saw that he could not take Loke’s head
after all. For how could he get the head without
touching the neck! But still he was determined to
punish the rascally Loke. So he sewed his lips
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
together, saying, “I cannot have your head, but I can
close your mouth so that you can no longer go about
boasting.”</p>

<p class='c003'>From that day on the gods felt safe from the frost-giants
who were always trying to get into the valley
of the gods. Those giants for more than half of the
year kept the world covered with ice and snow. They
hushed the flowing of the waters and the singing of
the birds. They hated the warm sunshine which
made the flowers bloom, and covered the mountains
with grass, and brought the songs from the birds.
They hated the god of the sun. They hated Thor,
for it was Thor’s hammer that kept them from the
land of the gods.</p>

<p class='c003'>Then a morning came when Thor awoke to find
that his hammer was gone. He searched and searched,
but the hammer could not be found. Then in great
fear he thought, “The giants have stolen the hammer
while I slept.” At that thought he was very
angry. Fire flashed from his eyes and the earth
trembled under his angry voice. “Come, Loke,” he
called, “we must be off at once to the land of the
giants. The gods can never be safe if the hammer
is in the hands of our enemies.”</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>
Loke thought of a way to get into the home of
the giants. He dressed himself like a huge bird and
on its magical wings flew straight to that high mountaintop
where the giants lived.</p>

<p class='c003'>The giants were surprised to see Loke, but they
gave him welcome. Loke soon learned that the giants
did have the hammer, but search as he would, he
could not find it. At last the mighty giant who was
greatest of all the giants said, “Thor may have his
hammer when the gods bring me a beautiful goddess
to be my wife.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Loke returned to tell Thor what he had heard.
Thor was puzzled, for what goddess would ever consent
to be the bride of a giant? Then Thor thought
of a plan to outwit the giant. He would dress as a
maiden and go to the land of the giants with Loke.
Perhaps he could trick the giants.</p>

<p class='c003'>Soon the broad wings of the huge bird were again
carrying Loke to the home of the giants. With Loke,
this time, rode Thor dressed as a maiden, wearing
a heavy veil over his face.</p>

<p class='c003'>They entered the land of the giants and were
greeted by the mighty giant, who was pleased that
a goddess had come to be his wife. He said to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>161</a></span>
servants, “Make a great feast and invite all the
giants to come to see my bride.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The giants came and the feast was spread. But
all the time, the maiden kept the veil over her face.
The mighty giant begged to look upon the face of
his bride. Then Loke said, “The hammer must be
ours before I can take the veil from the maiden’s
face.”</p>

<p class='c003'>So the mighty giant brought the hammer and
placed it on the maiden’s lap. At that moment, Loke
took the veil from the face and the giants saw before
them the mighty Thor with the powerful hammer
in his hands. They ran away in fear, as Thor
whirled the hammer round and round and balls of
fire flashed through the sky and peals of thunder
filled the air.</p>

<p class='c003'>Thor and Loke lost no time in getting back to the
land of the gods. All the gods were out to greet them,
and great was their joy to see the wonderful hammer.
Once more the gods were safe from the wicked
giants.</p>

  <h2 id='story20' class='c008'><b>Buried Treasures of the Old Sea Kings</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Many secrets of the long, long ago lie buried deep
under the ground. In every land there are people
who dig for such buried treasures. Only a few years
ago some men in Norway dug down to a most wonderful
treasure. What do you suppose they found?
It was an old, old ship that the early sailors of that
northland had sailed upon the seas more than two
thousand years ago.</p>

<p class='c003'>You can imagine how eagerly they worked to get
every piece of the old ship out of the ground and to
patch the pieces together to rebuild the old craft.
And what a beautiful ship they finally had!</p>

<p class='c003'>That ship, called the Oseborg Ship, stands today
in a shed in an open-air museum near Oslo. School
girls and boys go there with their teachers to see the
old ship. They almost always look the longest at the
big dragon’s head that rode on the front of the boat,
or at the <em>prow</em> of the boat as sailors call it.</p>

<p class='c003'>How many, many questions those pupils ask about
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
the old ship and about the old kings of the seas, who
were called <em>Vikings</em>. And you can imagine how
eagerly they listen to the tales of those daring sailors
who ventured far, far out into the unknown seas in
their long, black boats, each of which looked like a
huge animal with its head sticking up out of the
water.</p>

<p class='c003'>Other treasures have been dug from the earth in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
Sweden too. One old chest had in it many queer
things. One object from that old chest which interests
Swedish girls and boys is a large gold ring
with eight small rings upon it. Those rings of gold
had been used for money long ago before people made
coins. In those early days a man buying something
would break off a piece of gold from one of the rings
to pay for his purchase.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
  <h2 id='story21' class='c008'><b>Tales of the Old Sea Kings</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A long black boat, floating a red flag with a large
black raven upon it, glided through the fjords and
out to the open sea. At its prow stood a dragon’s
head; at its stern was the animal’s tail. Along its
sides, which looked like the body of a huge beast,
were rows of big round shields painted red, black,
and white. Behind those shields, on each side of the
long boat, sheltered from the sprays of water, sat
forty men who rowed the boat.</p>

<p class='c003'>So the old ship of the sea kings which now stands
in the museum had glided in the long, long ago.</p>

<p class='c003'>Those old kings of the seas who sailed such boats
are sometimes called Vikings. They got that name
from the waterways which are now called fjords, but
which were called <em>viks</em> in the early days. The Northmen
who kept their boats along the viks were called
<em>Vikings</em>.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nearly every Northman in those early days had a
boat. They needed boats to go about on the fjords,
but they also loved the open sea and sailed out upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>166</a></span>
it. Finding the material with which to make a boat
was an easy task, for many great trees grew on the
mountainsides of their lands.</p>

<p class='c003'>Some of the ships that sailed on the seas reached
the shores of other lands. In those lands the Vikings
saw shining gold and silver and sharp weapons of
bronze. The Northmen had no such treasures in
their land. After hearing about such riches, the Vikings
were not content without them. Some of the
braver ones said, “We will sail our boats to those
lands and take the rich treasures for ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c003'>So the Vikings became sea rovers, or pirates, as
sea robbers are often called. Those early Vikings
believed that the riches of the world belonged rightly
to the people who were strong enough to take them
for themselves.</p>

<p class='c003'>During the long winters, the Vikings stayed at
home. In the daytime, they mended their boats, or
built new boats. In the evenings they gathered
around the feast table and listened to tales of adventures
at sea. But when the warm days of sunshine
came, they hastened to plant their crops and then to
sail away to rob their neighbors.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Vikings had no instrument with which to tell
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_167' id='Page_167'>167</a></span>
the direction they were sailing. They had no glasses
through which to sight land. They took big birds,
called ravens, with them on their boats to help them.
When they wanted to find land, they would turn
loose one of the birds. The raven would fly to land.
By following the bird, the seamen too found land.</p>

<p>THE OLD VIKING SHIP REBUILT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>When one of the dragon-like ships came near the
shores of another land, the people on the shores were
filled with fear. Sometimes they tried to keep the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
robbers from landing on their shores. Then the Vikings
would get their battle axes and their shields and
fight their way into the land. They were cruel fighters.
Often they left whole towns in ruin—people
dying, and homes and crops in flames. For years the
Vikings kept up their life as sea robbers.</p>

<p class='c003'>After a time, some of the Vikings thought, “We
will take our families and build new homes for ourselves
in the rich lands we have visited.”</p>

<p class='c003'>So Viking boats sailed away from the northland
carrying whole families. Some went to nearby lands
where the English live. Others went to live on lands
that belong to the French. But many others sailed
farther away and built homes on an island which is
called Iceland. Other families followed them to Iceland.
Before many years there were more than a
thousand Vikings living on the island.</p>

<p class='c003'>Some of the Vikings who had gone to live in Iceland
still liked to sail the seas. Stories say that one
of them, a very daring seaman called Lief Ericsson,
sailed and sailed a very long way from his home. He
found a land with many green trees and green grass
and grapevines loaded with fruit. Lief called the
land Vinland because of the grapes. But now people
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_169' id='Page_169'>169</a></span>
believe that the shores which Lief Ericsson found
were really the shores of our land, America. Lief’s
voyage to Vinland was made about five hundred
years before Columbus found the new world.</p>

<p class='c003'>Some people have said, “The story that Lief Ericsson
found America cannot be true. A Viking ship
could not have crossed the big ocean.”</p>

<p class='c003'>But there was still a “Viking” living in Norway.
He was a young Captain Andersen. He believed
that the old Viking ships could cross the ocean.
Even as a boy he had dreamed of how fine it would
be to cross the ocean in a real Viking ship like those
of the old Viking days.</p>

<p class='c003'>About the time Captain Andersen was dreaming
his dream, one of the old Viking ships which now
stands in the museum was found buried deep under
ground. Captain Andersen saw that ship. A few
years later, the young captain heard of a World’s
Fair to be held in Chicago, a city in America. Then
he got an idea. He thought, “I’ll build a ship that
will be a true copy of the old Viking ship—I’ll build
it the same size as that old ship and will sail it with
the same equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to
America. I’ll sail the ship through the waters of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
North America to Chicago and show it to the visitors
at the World’s Fair.”</p>

<p class='c003'>And the young captain set about the task of building
the ship. Of course he had difficulties. He had to
have money, but he got it. Finally the ship was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span>
built. It was named the <em>Viking</em> and Captain Andersen
was made its commander.</p>

<p class='c003'>The <em>Viking</em> set sail on April 30, 1893, with a crew
of twelve men. On June 13, it reached America.
Captain Andersen’s dream had come true.</p>

<p class='c003'>The <em>Viking</em> was taken to Chicago. Thousands and
thousands of visitors at the World’s Fair saw the old
ship.</p>

<p class='c003'>The <em>Viking</em> was left in Chicago. It still stands
under a shelter in Lincoln Park. On the old ship is
a message which says that the ship came across the
ocean under its own sails. It came to carry a message
of good-will to the people of the United States of
America.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the days of the Vikings, a son was born to the
noble and bold Hjorvard and his wife Sigrlin. A
feast day was set on which the babe was to be named.
This was the custom for “name fastening” in Viking
homes.</p>

<p class='c003'>On the day for the “name fastening,” people for
miles about gathered at Hjorvard’s home. Hjorvard
took his son on his lap. A vessel filled with water
was brought in and Hjorvard poured water on the

people could hear him,</p>

like his mother, and be called his father’s son, for he
will wage war from an early age and wander far and
wide.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Hjorvard placed a sprig of garlic around his son’s
neck, as a “name fastening,” meaning that as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_173' id='Page_173'>173</a></span>
garlic stood high among the grasses so would little
Ivar stand among men. Then he placed by Ivar’s
side a double-edged sword and a coat of mail, a
shield, and a helmet of silver. Every animal born on
Hjorvard’s farm on the day of the birth of little Ivar
was to belong to the child.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'>Pictures have been found cut into rocks in Norway and Sweden. This is
an old rock picture of a Viking ship, made many, many years ago. It
shows a Viking defending his ship against two smaller ones.</p>

<p class='c003'>Ivar grew well. There was great joy in the family
when he cut his first tooth. His father, as was the
Viking custom, gave him a “tooth fee.” The gift was
a knife in a gold sheath. This was fastened to a
leather belt sewn with gold thread. He gave him also
a large farm where he would live when he became a
man.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
As time went on Ivar grew to be a beautiful child;
he was fair and had blue eyes. Like all boys of his
age he loved to play. Nothing pleased him more
than to put in the water a toy boat with a sail and
watch it go out to sea.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Ivar was six years old his parents began to
think of sending him to be fostered. Boys who were
to be great warriors were not brought up at home
but sent to some friend who was wise and brave, to
be educated. Ivar’s father and mother chose a brave
man named Gudbrand to educate Ivar.</p>

<p class='c003'>Ivar’s father made ready to send a messenger to
Gudbrand. On the day when the messenger was to
sail, a fleet of fifteen boats was seen coming towards
the shore. Each ship carried a white shield on its
mast. This meant that they were friendly and peaceful.</p>

<p class='c003'>As the vessels came nearer shore they made a
beautiful sight. Along the sides of the boats were
the colored shields of the warriors. The sails, too,
were striped in bright colors. Ahead of the other
ships was a dragon ship flying a flag with an eagle
on it. By this flag every one knew that this was
Gudbrand’s ship.</p>

<p class='c003'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
Hjorvard and Sigrlin were glad to see Gudbrand’s
ship coming at this time. Hjorvard went out to meet
the great warrior. There were great feasts that day.</p>

<p class='c003'>The next day when Gudbrand was talking to some
of the warriors, Hjorvard came up to him with Ivar
in his arms. He put Ivar on Gudbrand’s knees. It
was an old custom that the man upon whose knee a
child was seated was bound to become his “fosterer.”
Hjorvard’s men shouted with joy to see Ivar seated
upon the knees of Gudbrand, who was known for his
wisdom and bravery.</p>

<p class='c003'>At last the day came when Ivar was to leave his
mother. Sigrlin was sad to see him go for he was to
be away for long years. Ivar walked down to the
shore between his parents, chatting merrily. As the
ship left the shore Sigrlin stood on the headland
watching it go. Then, with a deep sigh, she went
homeward.</p>

<p class='c003'>The wind was fair and after a sail of three days
Gudbrand’s ships reached home. Sigrid, his wife,
was well pleased when she saw Ivar. She prepared a
room for him close to her own.</p>

<p class='c003'>For a few days Ivar was homesick. He missed his
father and mother and his playmates. Everything
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
was new and strange. Soon, however, he grew to love
his new home and his foster parents.</p>

<p class='c003'>Gudbrand and Sigrid had a son named Hjalmar.
He was a year older than Ivar. The two boys became
good friends and learned together. As they grew
older they were taught gymnastic exercises, games of
ball, running, wrestling, jumping, and swimming.
They learned how to steer and sail a boat. They
learned how to ride. They even learned ship building
and worked in the ship yards. Both boys were
taught how to write on birch bark and to engrave
letters on stone, gold, and silver.</p>

<p class='c003'>Ivar and Hjalmar were better at sports than any
other boys of their age. They could swim like eels
and could shoot straight.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Ivar was fifteen years old Gudbrand gave
him a beautiful ship called <em>Stallion of the Surf</em>.
Hjalmar also received a beautiful ship called <em>Deer of
the Surf</em>. Gudbrand took the two boys sailing with
him and trained them to build camp and to cook for
themselves.</p>

<p class='c003'>Ivar began to wish to see his own people again.
Then the two boys sailed to the home of Ivar’s father
and mother. They were greeted with great joy by
Hjorvard and Sigrlin, who treated Hjalmar as kindly
as if he were their own son.</p>

  <h2 id='story23' class='c008'><b>Planting the Flag of Norway at the Bottom of the Earth</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Crowds of people stood on the banks of the fjord
at Oslo in Norway. Bands were playing and flags
were waving. Cheer after cheer arose from the crowd
as the boat, the <em>Fram</em>, came into sight. On the <em>Fram</em>
was a brave Norwegian named Nansen who was returning
from adventures in Eskimo land.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the crowd which cheered Nansen was a lad
seventeen years old who also dreamed dreams of adventure.
That lad was Roald Amundsen. “Some
day,” said Roald, “I’ll travel as far north as I can
go. I’ll stand at the North Pole—the spot at the very
top of the world.”</p>

<p class='c003'>People had known for a long time then that the
earth is a big ball. The spot at the very top of the
big ball is called the North Pole and the spot at the
very bottom of the ball is called the South Pole. No
matter which way a person standing at the North
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>180</a></span>
Pole looked he would be looking south toward the
other end of the ball. If he stood at the South Pole,
no matter which way he looked, he would be looking
north towards the top of the ball. But when Roald
was dreaming his dreams no one had stood at either
the North Pole or the South Pole. Roald thought,
“Perhaps I can be the first to visit the North Pole.”</p>

<p class='c003'>How would he know when he reached a spot which
no one had seen? Roald had seen the instrument
which sailors use to tell direction when out at sea.
It is a needle that always points toward the north
star and that star is almost directly overhead at the
North Pole. Roald knew that he could carry such a
needle with him. With it he would be able to tell
when he came to the North Pole. For there the
needle could no longer point north, so it would move
about trying to find north.</p>

<p class='c003'>But Roald was then too young for such an adventure.
Ten years passed after Nansen’s return
before he began to prepare for a journey to the
North Pole. He was to sail in the same boat that
Nansen had used, the <em>Fram</em>. Amundsen’s party was
almost ready to start from Norway when news came
that an American, named Peary, had reached the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>
North Pole. Already the Stars and Stripes floated
over that spot at the top of the earth.</p>

<p class='c003'>Roald Amundsen still longed to visit the North
Pole, but he decided not to go at that time. He said,
“No one has yet reached the South Pole—at the bottom
of the earth. We will go to the South Pole. Perhaps
the Norwegian flag may be the first to float
there.”</p>

<p class='c003'>On a bright sunny day in August, 1910, about a
year after Peary found the North Pole, Amundsen
and his men set out on the long journey from Norway
to the South Pole at the bottom of the earth.
He knew that the Antarctic (ant ark tic)—the land
and water at the bottom of the earth—is a place of
ice and snow. Amundsen knew much about cold
lands of ice and snow as he had always lived in Norway.
He had traveled on skis ever since he was a
small boy. He had read many books about the land
to which he was going.</p>

<p class='c003'>He planned everything very carefully so that he
and his men would have every chance to succeed.
He said, “If a person starting on a hard task prepares
for the task carefully, he is likely to succeed—and
then people say he had <em>good luck</em>. If a person
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span>
does not prepare carefully, he is likely to fail—and
then people say he had <em>bad luck</em>.”</p>

<p class='c003'>On the deck of the <em>Fram</em> were ninety-six Eskimo
dogs. Amundsen said, “The Eskimo dog is the best
animal to endure the cold and to pull sledges over
the ice and snow.” Amundsen gave each man in the
crew a number of dogs to be in his care. The men
named their dogs and began making friends with
them as soon as the journey began. They must have
the dogs ready to work well with them by the time
they reached the Antarctic.</p>

<p class='c003'>On the deck of the boat too were skis and snowshoes,
heavy blankets, suits of Eskimo clothes, suits
of reindeer skins, canned meat and other foods, and
lumber ready to fit together for a house. Amundsen
had tried to make sure that he and his men would <em>be
lucky</em>.</p>

<p class='c003'>The first part of the journey was through the
North Sea along the coast of Norway. Then the
<em>Fram</em> sailed into the Atlantic Ocean. As they traveled
farther and farther south, the weather got
warmer each day. The men saw the sun get higher
and higher in the sky each noon. Then they came to
a place where the sun at noon was almost directly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>183</a></span>
over their heads. They were then halfway between
the North Pole and the South Pole.</p>

<div id='img62' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic064'>
<a href='images/img62f.jpg'><img src='images/img62.jpg' alt='' class='ig064' /></a>
<p>AMUNDSEN’S EQUIPMENT, NOW IN A MUSEUM</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The men put on light summer clothes. The dogs
kept under the shelter built for them, but still they
suffered from the heat.</p>

<p class='c003'>The <em>Fram</em> went on farther south, but the weather
began to grow cooler and cooler. The farther the
boat went from the place where the sun was almost
directly over head at noon, the cooler the weather
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_184' id='Page_184'>184</a></span>
was. The men put on warmer clothing and the dogs
left their shelters.</p>

<p class='c003'>By New Year’s Day the <em>Fram</em> was in the icy
waters of the Antarctic. The men saw huge pieces
of ice floating in the water. The boat had to make its
way through the ice. In about two weeks more, they
reached a wall of ice about one hundred feet high.
Amundsen was expecting that wall of ice, which was
the edge of the great field of ice called <em>The Great Ice
Barrier</em>.</p>

<p class='c003'>The <em>Fram</em> could go no farther. The men unloaded
the supplies on the ice. Not far from that spot, they
dug into the ice and made a cellar where they stored
their supplies. Over it they set up the house they
had brought from Norway. They called their new
home <em>Framheim</em>, which means <em>Fram home</em>.</p>

<p class='c003'>In January the weather in the Antarctic is much
like June weather in the far north. Day after day
the men watched the sun go in a circle around their
home on the ice. The sun there moved much the same
as they had seen it move in the Arctic where Hammerfest
lies. At Hammerfest, that town which is
farther north than any other town, the sun is in the
east in the early morning, in the south at noon, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_185' id='Page_185'>185</a></span>
the west in the late afternoon, and in the north at
midnight. But in the Antarctic the men saw the sun
in the east in the early morning, in the <em>north</em> at noon,
in the west in the late afternoon, and in the <em>south</em> at
midnight.</p>

<p class='c003'>The men knew that after April twenty-second the
sun would not be seen in this land at the bottom of
the earth for four months. They would not have
time to reach the South Pole before that long night
came. They must wait for another summer.</p>

<p class='c003'>During the long night the men lived comfortably
in their house on the ice. They looked over every
sledge, every piece of harness, their clothes, and their
skis to make sure that everything was in shape for
the trip over the ice to the South Pole.</p>

<p class='c003'>The sun appeared in the sky for only a few minutes
on August twenty-fourth. Each day after that
it crept a little higher and stayed a little longer until
at last the long day came when the sun was in the
sky for weeks and weeks without setting.</p>

<p class='c003'>For weeks after the sun appeared, the weather was
bitter cold. The men watched for signs of warmer
weather. Late in September they saw a seal crawl
out of the water. They then knew that they soon
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span>
would have warmer days, so they began to prepare
for the journey to the pole.</p>

<p class='c003'>On October twentieth, Amundsen and four other
men with four sledges and fifty-two dogs set out
from Framheim. The sledges were loaded with provisions
enough to last four months. As they journeyed
south, they stopped at different places and
built up piles of snow blocks. The heaps of snow
would help them find their way back. Under the
blocks of snow they put supplies which they would
need as they came back.</p>

<p class='c003'>The dogs made good time over the ice of the Antarctic.
They traveled about seventeen miles a day.
The men on their skis easily kept up with the dogs.
But by the middle of November they came to snow-covered
mountains. Some of them are two miles high.
Travel was then harder. The party traveled up about
one mile. They then rested. Travel was easier for a
few days as they had reached a high level stretch of
land which we call a plateau (pla tō). They then began
to climb mountains again. Early in December
they were up two miles high. From that time on they
traveled on another plateau. Travel was easy on this
level stretch of land. The men knew that the South
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>187</a></span>
Pole was on this plateau. The end of their journey
seemed near.</p>

<p class='c003'>On the night of December thirteenth, they had
that strange feeling that something was going to happen.
And at three o’clock the next day they were on
the spot which they reckoned to be the South Pole.
The happy men seized each other’s hands. How
glad they were! They then did the most important
act of the journey—they planted the flag of Norway
on that spot.</p>

<p class='c003'>The hands of all five men held the flag as it was set
into place. Amundsen would have it that way. He
said later, “It was not for one man to do this; it was
for all who staked their lives in the struggle, and
held together through thick and thin.”</p>

<p class='c003'>As the men put the flag in place, they said, “Thus
we plant thee, Beloved Flag, at the South Pole, and
give the plateau on which it lies the name <em>King
Haakon VII’s Plateau</em>.”</p>

<p class='c003'>So while the Stars and Stripes floated at the top
of the earth, the red, white, and blue flag of Norway
floated at its bottom.</p>

<p class='c003'>In about six weeks the happy men were back in
Framheim. About a week later the <em>Fram</em> set sail for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>188</a></span>
the long return trip to Norway. But early in March
the <em>Fram</em> reached land from which messages could be
sent and the whole world soon knew that the flag of
Norway had been planted at the South Pole. And
the whole world did honor to the brave men from
the north who planted it there.</p>
